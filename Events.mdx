## Event Keys

Event Keys was born out of a need to further decentralize our IRL event programming and expand our reach beyond the diversity of events coming from our Cities subDAOs (formerly LA, New York, and London).

Event Keys create city-specific experiences for the FWB community to come together locally, with an eye toward programming, building relationships, and strengthening local networks. Part of the idea behind Event Keys is that they are accessible: they are not necessarily full-fledged exhibitions or parties that require exorbitant funding or a high demand run-of-show. Event keys are often more low-lift gatherings whose resources are the onus of the group to source. Think: direct-payable direct dinners, art crawls, picnics, film screenings, or food tours.

**The How** we do things at FWB are laid out below - written by the former Cities team who were global experts in planning events. 

**The Why** we do thinks is laid out in our Pattern Language, inspired by Christopher Alexander's Timeless Way of Building

**The Who** should always be done by the local programming experts who know their locales better then anyone else.

### FWB Dinner Parties

In addition to Event Keys, this Spring you're cordially invited to host a shared meal for and with other FWB members. Use this as a chance to connect with more FWB members in your region, share a delicious meal, and cook up some new friendships.

#### How it works:

- Use [this form](https://airtable.com/shr05mgzfQqovtove) to share your interest in hosting a dinner party in your space.

- If approved, you will receive $250 USDC to spend on dinner-related expenses.

- Aim for 10+ guests, with at least 50% being FWB members.

- All official dinner parties will be added to our [Events page](https://www.fwb.help/events) via Gatekeeper so other FWB members can find them + RSVP.

- FWB's Events team will provide lightweight support to hosts to ensure your dinner party is set up for success.

- Note that all hosts will be asked to share a recipe + photos from your dinner, which we'll be compiling into a cookbook and digital zine for FWB members.

For references and further information, be sure to review [FWB’s Event Pattern Language doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5dX8D6IAmsr247f1zaBgkIKt2n9-vse/view) (aka our all-purpose manual for vibe-building), and our [Dinner-Booking SOP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s400rhaub_wl5scx64Krv4jPWnVoAqv5) (which includes a treasure trove of tips for hosting an incredible and seamlessly executed dinner).

#### FAQs:

<b> What’s expected of dinner party hosts? </b>

Hosts are expected to arrange and/or cook a meal for dinner attendees, and welcome all FWB members who RSVP into their space (note that it’s possible to limit the number of people who can RSVP). This could mean you make your dinner party a potluck and ask guests to bring a dish to share, or it could mean you make a huge batch of your grandma’s famous spaghetti and provide wine and mocktails. If you can offer versions of your dish that suit various dietary restrictions, that’s great (but not required). Hosts are also expected to help promote their dinner party and do some outreach to ensure their dinner will be well attended. Lastly, hosts are expected to follow the FWB code of conduct and ensure their party is as accessible and friendly as possible.

<b> Do I need to live in one of FWB’s main cities to host a dinner party? </b>

If you live in NYC, LA, SF, or London, that’s great—there are lots of FWB members near you, and it shouldn’t be too tricky to build a robust guest list. If you live in a region where fewer FWB members live, you’ll need to do some research/outreach to make sure enough FWB members live nearby who can come to your event. Aim to have 10 or more people at your dinner, with at least 50% of attendees being FWB members. To find members in your area, try asking in your nearest region on Discord (under the FWB REGION channel category) to see who might be your neighbor.

<b> How will FWB support dinner party hosts? </b>

FWB will supply each host with 250 USDC to spend on your dinner in whatever way makes sense. We’ll also help spread the word about the dinner party series through social media and our Events page, and we’ll provide some general tips and best practices to help ensure your dinner party is a success.

### DJ Event

#### Overview
As far as nightlife is concerned, nothing quite tells the story of a city like a night backed to the sounds of a DJ who knows what they are doing. As FWB aims to connect the world of web3 to culture, careful considerations should be made about the space and sounds we operate within, and how we go about our business. 

#### Programming

##### Dynamic Programming

Our members are a diverse group. Tastes and ideas about music will vary wildly, and it’s important that we recognise this through our event programming, but not to be governed by it. Trust your own ability to seek and find what is cool and present it in a way that feels accessible even for those with less experimental musical tastes. 

Whilst it is important to represent as much as we can, it’s important to always ask yourself the question about how the music makes sense within the boundaries of the city you operate in. Understanding the musical history of the city with a grasp on where it’s headed next should always be at the forefront of your thinking. If we are to program correctly, we need to be a step ahead of the competition, whilst respecting the tastes of the audience. Finding a balance that works will result in highly respected events which will transcend the borders of our private discord channels and elevate the FWB brand to the music and culture sector further. 

Ensure we are not repetitive in what we program to keep the city exciting and feeling alive. We can have continuity in our branding and our message, but make efforts to keep switching up the talent we book and ensure it is representative of our vision and stays true to our core values. Always be one step ahead of the game, don’t fall into the traps of booking the same tired line ups as our competitors will be doing. Thinking outside the box will be the key here - take your cues and paths from the club scene and not who is getting booked at crypto events. 

##### Programming Guiding Principles 

- Collaborate with Governance and Operations on the Macrovision of what city needs • The programming should create open and safe spaces for people to be themselves and allow for authentic connections. 
- Our programming should tell the story of where we are located, highlight our cultural partners, values and what we want to share with our guests. 
- Partners and Talent are our lifeblood, please treat accordingly. 
- All types of people reflected in programming. 
- Mix up locations we operate in. Our cities have plenty of hidden gems outside of the regular tried and tested haunts. 
- Create opportunities to bring artists into the DAO via bookings, but don’t force it - some hand-holding is to be expected at times. 
- Money is good, access is better. 

##### Booking The Venue 
Booking a venue for a date is usually the first step of planning a club night / DJ event. Depending on the kind of event you have planned, it’s important to gauge your booking on the scale of your needs and expectations for the event. If you’re booking an international headliner for an event we plan to sell tickets to the public for, you might need a larger venue. If we plan on a small open decks event for a handful of our members to DJ at, you might just want a 100 cap room with half decent sound and enough budget left to put a few drinks behind the bar. Figure out what we need, and then set about finding the space. 

If you’re an experienced clubber in your city you may already have ideas about these spaces. If you don’t, open up conversation with some of the more experienced members of your city DAO about their favorite venues around the scale you have in mind. 

Reach out to the venues. Calling by telephone is usually the best way to do this - call around an hour or two before their usual opening time and you might catch somebody who can help. Email also works - but people can be notoriously slow to get back to you due to the late nights and busy days they work. Telephone conversation followed up with an email tends to be the best practice. 

Be sure to ask questions about the following: 

- What do they supply for the cost? 
- Do they provide security? 
- Do they supply bar & staff (if this is a club / bar venue this may be standard of course)? 
- Opening hours & cut off times. 
- Do they have a person who works on the door to check tickets etc.? 
- Do they supply a sound system & sound engineer on site? 
- Is there a minimum bar spend / deposit on the price? 
- Do they take any rake of ticket sales? (Normally the promoter - FWB - should get to keep ticket revenue unless the hire fee is waived for a percentage of sales). 

Don’t hesitate to check the venue out yourself. If you’ve never been inside the venue in question, it’s important you go and have a look inside it to see if it fits your needs ahead of agreeing the dates and costs. 

If you are not booking a club / bar venue for a DJ event - you’ll also need to consider sound hire. This can be expensive and will require a lot of extra work on the day to set up - make sure you factor into your budget any hire fees for equipment and rigging should you not be booking an existing club space for a DJ event.

##### Approaching & Booking Talent 

Booking artists to play the events can vary in experience. In some cases, we’ll have people already active in the DAO who can represent what we’re about and will likely be interested in playing our events. Identify members of your city who are artists / performers and open some private dialogue about potential collaborations with them. Listen to their music / view their art and if it fits the vibe of an event you’re planning, reach out to them and see if we can make things work within budget. If we’re approaching artists from outside the DAO, conversations may be direct with them, or in many cases will be discussions with artist’s booking agents. Below are some guidelines on dealing with different types of artist. These guidelines can be applied to working with visual artists as well as DJ’s or live performers should you be incorporating that into an event. 

- Talent operating inside the DAO & is a member. 
	- Initial outreach via private Discord message. 
	- Let them know you’re planning an event and have a date in mind. 
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent. 
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the artist can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the artist on call will help get the message across to the agent. 
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with an artist present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the artist if they’ve said we can deal directly with them. 

- Talent is not a member. 
	- Find the talent on social media - twitter / instagram. See if they have an email contact for them or their agent. If they don’t have it public, send a DM where possible and ask who you can speak to about a possible booking. 
	- Give an outline about the event dates and location. 
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent. 
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the artist can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the artist on call will help get the message across to the agent. 
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with an artist present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the artist if they’ve said we can deal directly with them. 

##### Some Questions You’ll Need The Answers For.

Artists and/or booking agents will have questions about the event you have planned. It’s important you know details on the following before you engage with talent for the event. Budgets can sometimes determine how far we can stretch - but don’t feel bound by the budgets. Some artists will not expect riders and travel to be covered, but others will expect it. Make sure conversations are had on these things though so it is clear on the day of the event. 

- Date & Time of the event 
- Location of the event 
- Tech set up 
	- DJ - What is the turntable set up there? What is the setting? What kind of sound system? ○ Visual Artist - Where will they be displaying? Will we provide screens / projectors?
	- Budget - what fee do we have available to pay them? 
- Line up - talent will want to know who else they will be appearing on a lineup with. Share anyone else who is booked, or be prepared to have conversations about the other artists we’re approaching. 
- Expenses & Riders - will we be providing expenses for travel / hotels? Will we be providing food & drinks / hospitality for the talent? 

#### Marketing + Timelines 
- Create and approve all promotional assets for the event 1 week ahead of the announcement date.
- For small events exclusively for FWB members, at least 14 days notice is recommended ahead of the event to announce and promote within Discord / Town Hall / FWB Communications.
- For large club nights promoted beyond the membership group and offering up tickets to the public, a 2 month lead time is suggested. This gives a few weeks prior to public listing where FWB members and token holders can claim a ticket ahead of the event going public where the remaining capacity can be sold on regular ticketing sites like Resident Advisor. 6-8 weeks is the ideal amount of time to promote a club event online.

##### 6 Weeks Out 

- Book Venue 
	- Given the increased demand, securing a venue as early as possible will prevent headaches down the line. For certain conferences you will need more lead time. Confirm that the space you booked is appropriate for your target capacity.
- Book Talent 
	- DAO first approach, before talking to agents. Our greatest selling tool should be $FWB and payment through our token can provide access to our DAO. Try and structure your bookings to boost and broaden the DAos membership 
- Estimate Costs 
	- Once you’ve secured the talent, the venue and any food/drink packages, provide an estimation of the expenses and number of expected attendees in Airtable. 

##### 4 Weeks Out 
- Create Marketing Materials 
	- Now that you’ve locked in the programming and the venue, you can put together a flyer using our approved marketing materials and brand kit. 
- Venue Walkthrough 
	- Make sure to discuss staffing, any tech needs, menu, drinks, any type of bar arrangement (open/drinks tokens/paid) and make sure to have it all in writing so there is no misalignment in terms of expectations 
- Confirm any budget details or minimums with the venue to ensure expectations are aligned 
- Book supporting talent - think what will amplify the event further; NFT artists doing visual projections? More traditional touches like dancers or interactive content capture? 

##### 3 Weeks Out 
- Book additional production requirements - DJ kit, AV equipment and content capture. Look to the DAo first for trusted suppliers 
- Finalize flyer and Gatekeeper RSVP page 
- Get event on FWB Event Google Calendar 
- Send Event to Editorial team for coverage in TLDR (if requested) 
- Distribute RSVP link in proper Discord channels, including any temporary channels created for the specific conference 
- Send any deposit that is necessary to hold the venue

##### 1 Week Out 
- Create POAP (if distributing) & print QR codes for POAPs if needed 
- Check with the venue to make sure you are on the same page about the hours of the event and any schedule of food, or other arrangements 
- Manage the RSVP List (cut off RSVPs at a certain point if there is a venue limit, consider cutting off early if necessary to leave space for POC, women and/or FWB leadership who did not RSVP in time) 
- Confirm photographer or divvy up content creation responsibilities with local team ● Discuss settlement/payment with venue to ensure that payment expectations are set 

##### Day of Run of Show 
- Finalize guest list and make sure venue has your guest list, along with any details on whether attendees are allowed a +1 or other details, at least 3 hour prior to doors opening
- Welcome the point person from the venue and introduce yourself and any other team members to the venue staff 
- At least 1 hour before doors do a full venue walk through including the entrance and check-in points 
- Do a tech check for any AV or music equipment 
- Make sure music is on to create a vibe at least 10 minutes before doors open ● If there are any bar details that need to be discussed with the venue (open bar, bar minimum, drink sponsors or specials) double check the details day of with the staff of the venue 
- As attendees arrive, greet them and deliver POAP QR code if printed 
- Even at an open bar, do not get intoxicated 
- “Settle up” (thoroughly review the bill, and other charges, and making remaining payments) the night of the event (or the next day if prearranged with the venue) so that there are no lingering issues with payment 

##### Post 
- Reconcile budget and upload all receipts to airtable 
- Collect any content 
- Conduct guestlist review/attendance rates for future intel 
- Provide TL;DR to cityDAO’s at large with learnings and successes 

#### Questions To Ask 
- What story are we telling with our programming? 
- What will people tell their friends about FWB? 
- How is programming driving brand awareness? 
- How can we use programming to make an impression? 
- How is programming driving applications? 
- How do we support the community?
- What larger events can we make?

### Grand Dining

#### Overview
On rare occasions, we go all out. Holidays, Season Openers / Closers, Prom. These productions require loads of work and intersect many skill sets. On the grandest of shows, we have created a framework to incorporate the Global team, the City, and the vendors that it takes to make it happen.
This type of programming should only be done once a season. These events are legendary but also need a lot of attention. Be mindful of the resources necessary to pull this off.

#### Goals
A large format event should have some very specific goals when going all out on the programming. When you’re creating a Grand Event, consider the following as some important indicators of success:
- Driving value to the token
- Creating valuable experiences for the community
- Building brand awareness and positive sentiment in other communities
- Building bridges between FWB and the local community
- Creating on-ramps for non-members to join

#### Programming
Programming a Grand Event will require specialization in the creative, operational, logistical, and production capacity across food and drink, audio / visual presentation, arts and culture, transportation, security, and the battery of elements that come together to make a large-scale fete.

**IS IT VIABLE?**
- Are there enough members for success?
- Is it organic to the local membership?
- Do we have the resources to produce this experience meaningfully?
- Does this serve members of all ages, abilities, and reasonable preferences?
- Will this matter?

**STAY ON STRATEGY**
- Collaborate with [Governance and Operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJ-8sgLcnAXKIlvzm7CtnW5x-GUqfSJxv1_AENaxyy0/edit) on the macro-objectives of the City
- Remain aligned and additive to the strategy of the local membership
- Leverage this moment as a key event in the overall seasonal / annual strategy
- Create achievable KPIs around the event for you to measure success and improvement

**PLATFORM OTHERS**
- Use the moment and resources to connect other communities to ours
Program the network diversity we wish to see reflected within our own community
- Leverage our access

**SAFETY FIRST W/ FOOD & DRINK**
- Always consider accessibility, geography, transportation, and security
- Never serve alcohol to a minor
- Always play the host by observing and taking responsibility for the occasion
- Never promote the overconsumption of alcohol
- Always ask the audience to provide any life threatening allergies to you directly and communicate with the Chef / restaurant to ensure there is no mistake

#### Event Safety
“Hospitality is present when something happens for you. It is absent when something happens to you. Those two simple prepositions - for and to - express it all.” - Danny Meyer

An event is a multi-sensory hospitality experience. The act of sharing content

#### SETUP
##### Determine Type of Experience
FWB Cities recommends three styles of dining events for our community:
- **Culinary Experiences (Small)**
	This is the epicurean celebration of food and it’s process, centering the conversation on the dining experience itself with a fully seated and detailed service of food, drink, and accoutrement
- **Group Dining (Medium)**
	The most typical dining event for communion exists in restaurants, residences, or pop up experiences with less choreography and cerebral food and drink service in favor of feeding friends together. Group dining is often served family style, plattered, potluck, or as a buffet. Rarely does Group Dining make sense with individual guest orders.
- **Local Flavor (Large)**
	These are non-exclusive dining destinations that can accommodate the masses. Local flavor is all about quick service and volume. Think beer halls, wine gardens, food courts, pizzerias, taquerias, sandwich shops, coffee shops, curry shops, and more... These are by nature, community establishments and have the infrastructure to host large groups on demand.
	
In general, dining events can be elaborate and expensive, or informal and communal. To organize pricing and selections, the table below is relevant to the US but is also decent for most developed nations currency exchange:
- Luxury: >$200pp + tax + gratuity (25%) + additional customization
- Premium: $100pp + tax + gratuity (20%)
- Banquet: $50pp + tax + gratuity (15%)
- Casual: $25pp + tax + gratuity (10%)
- Economical: <$25pp + tax

##### Event Examples :
- **(SMALL / PREMIUM CULINARY EXPERIENCE)** FWB NYC is hosting a recruitment dinner for our most active members that have onboarded new memberships, it will be a premium culinary experience for 12 guests at Porcelain in Ridgewood, around $2400 from the monthly budget to net 12 new members from this group.
- **(MEDIUM / CASUAL GROUP DINING)** FWB LA is doing a casual dinner party for 30 people at Highly Likely Cafe with member Chef Kat Turner who is gifting her space and charging $3000 all in for the private dinner, followed by cocktails for 30 more members.
- **(LARGE / ECONOMICAL LOCAL FLAVOR)** FWB MIAMI is hosting a day party to celebrate the chapter launch and approval of 250 new memberships in Season 5. Sweet Beach can accommodate a walkup BBQ sandwich station for 300 guests at $25 per person.

#####Choosing Event Day
**Choosing an event day is tricky.** Strong organizers know when to crowdsource answers and source answers for the crowd. Over time, this will become more predictive and intuitive. In the earlier stages, we recommend crowdsourcing broad schedules. Once you’ve selected the venue, you should crowdsource the event date:
- Check calendars for holidays that may indicate members traveling out of town
- Choose two date options and offer a vote with Reactions (Discord)
- Don’t overcomplicate, just suggest a couple of date options and go with the higher tally

##### Event Hours
Each dining event is going to be unique but **three hours is a good rule of thumb.** Some things to
remember:
- Set up and breakdown can take a few hours on each side of the event
- Communication with your guests will take a few hours on each side of the event
- 90 minutes is a good time limit for seating, after that it can get boring for the guest
- Allow 30 minutes for guest arrivals
- Allow an hour for guests to mingle to follow

When booking a meal period, use your instinct on the local geography and understand the general availability of the membership. Consider the following:
- What’s the traffic in your local area?
- Is there parking near the venue?
- Will people be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the start time?

Pro-tips for keeping people on time:
- Share a Google calendar invite with the reminders turned on
- Push messaging in local channels around strict seating times
- Limit capacity of every event and make sure there is always demand for the next

##### Venue & Size
Leads should possess a working knowledge of relevant venues in the city to host experiences. This includes food and drink establishments in varying neighborhoods of the City they lead. Use your best judgement to pick the vibe, here’s some standards:
- Best to have indoor and outdoor areas
- Mom and pop / independently owned business (ie. non-chain restaurant or establishment)
- Encouraged to look for establishments that are womxn / LGBTQ+ / POC owned
- Quality ambience free of fluorescent lights, offensive music, or questionable authenticity
- Climate control for heating / cooling / coverage in inclement weather
- An area that feels private or semi-private to the group
- An ambient volume or volume control that allows people to hear one another speak
- If outdoors, a floor to move on wheels or heels
- Parking accessible within a safe distance

##### Booking an Establishment
- Choose a location in the city that fits the above
- Visit the venue for a bite and a chance to get a vibe
- Assess the F&B offering to accommodate common dining restrictions (GF, DF, V, VEG)
- If it’s a fit and feeling, ask for a manager on duty and tell them you’d like to host an event
- Ask the number of guests they can accommodate for group dining
- Visit any private or semi-private for dining
- Find out if you can play your own music
- If it seems easy, it will be
- If it seems complicated, it will be
- Get the contact information and shake hands
- Follow up with a correspondence with the following in mind:
	- For a Dining Experience: you’ll likely return to the venue or need a call / meeting to plan
	- For Group Dining: ask for prix fixe or family style menus they offer
	-  For Local Flavor events: confirm the hours of operation on your intended event day
- Make sure there is room to reduce or increase capacity 20% of seats available
- Ask for their availability for two dates in the weeks to follow
- Return to the #channel and propose the two dates for Reaction vote
- Take the prevailing vote and confirm the date with the venue
- Make a deposit if required

##### Producing a Dining Event (Off Site Dining)
When hosting a dinner at a residential, private, or non-commercial space, there are an endless array of variables to consider. This is a practical guide to making the most of your dining event:
- What makes the venue more special than the convenience of an establishment?
- If that’s hard to answer, go to an establishment. If that’s easy, continue on...
- Does the venue meet the same criteria as the restaurant selection?
- Is the point of contact the final decision maker, owner, or operator?
- If yes, great. If not, find out who it is and be clear about the expectation. Make sure they approve.
- Visit the venue prior to event, take tons of photos of all areas and document the condition
- Communicate with the host or manager to confirm:
	- The venue is large enough to accommodate the guests
	- You can access the venue 3+ hours in advance of the event to prepare
	- The venue is clean for the guests arrival
	- The space is in working order (lights, restrooms, sound, parking)
	- If you are cooking in the venue, take notes on the following;
		- Gas, electric and plumbing are in working order
		- The heavy cooking equipment you can use
		- The pots, pans, and cooking utensils you can use
		- The cleaning supplies you can use
		- Whatever you can not use, you will bring
	- For service:
		- Count the number of plates, platters, silverware, and glassware inventory
		- If enough for the event, confirm you can use all of it
		- If not, order tossware / compostables or pickup at a party supply store
		- Make sure the refrigeration and freezer can be emptied in advance
		- If not, bring a cooler and ice bucket
- Type up your notes and confirm on email
- Once the date is confirmed with the host, buy event insurance from EventHelper.com
- Share the certificate issued with the host for peace of mind for all
- Order some handy items in advance:
	- Wine key and opener
	- Blue painters tape / labels and a Sharpie
	- 6 pack of toilet paper
	- 6 rolls paper towels
	- Cutting board and knife
	- Lighter
	- Votive candles
	- A couple extra large bowls or platters if you have them
	- Serving spoons
	- Napkins
	- Food storage containers for leftover food
	- Anything else that’s not provided

#### Ticketing & RSVP
You need to create the promotional materials and registration for your event. All FWB events will utilize the Gatekeeper platform for RSVPs. This can host all your event details and utilize a tokengated, Web3 RSVP system:
- Create the event invitation using these Canva Templates:
	- [Square Flyer Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)
	- [IG Stories Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8eJ_PAk/6kJeQyDo8gVIlppM83pitw/view?utm_content=DAFX8eJ_PAk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)

- Load your event and details to the [Gatekeeper app](https://gatekeep.it/)
- Have your Operations counterpart proof the work
- Test drive the platform and run through the process

- Disposable or Polaroid camera (takes the pressure off phone photos)
- If seated, magic marker name tags “HELLO MY NAME IS” work great
- Pins, stickers, or other identifying wearables to distinguish the audience for the venue
- Brick batteries with cables to help people charge phones

### Digital Events

Below is an overview on how to get involved in digital events. If you'd like to stay up to date on digital event offerings you can view [this Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2qmoc32nlcg7ug92j91rtgrngc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLisbon) and subscribe to it by clicking the '+' in the bottom right corner of your browser..

#### The Short Version 

**Digital Event Expectations:**

If you are hosting a Digital Event, expectations are as follows:

- Well thought out event that sounds professional and starts promptly. If the event is recurring, it should be reliable.
- Share description/guests/topics minimum 48hrs before air time, and ideally by Wednesday at midnight the week prior so we can get it in tl;dr.
- Strive for a minimum attendance of 2% of the active FWB community, and track event attendance. (This amounts to around 20 people in the audience)
- Record and share recordings after the event if you want the event to be archived.
- Engage with the editorial team and community for event promotion.

People showing up for live events is the best metric for success. You will report your real-time attendance, and we will have the data on how many people listen to the archived version of the show. We also of course encourage soliciting feedback on your event so you can improve for the next time :)

**What To Do Before And After Each Event:**

Before: You must submit [this form](https://forms.gle/bhciK4dGrtufEMeN7) at least 48 hours before your event, preferably by Thursday the week before your show so we can promote in tl;dr. This form includes date, time, location (which voice channel will you be on? Is it on main stage? Is it on zoom? Twitter spaces?), show description and a spot to upload art if you have any.

After: Submit [this form](https://forms.gle/7LHAUtaouKC1jxqW6) after each event. This is where you report attendance and give us a link to your event recording if you want it to be archived. This form must be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

**How to record**

If you know how to record from discord using Krisp, OBS, Garageband or Soundflower, please feel free to do so. Here is a guide to using [Krisp](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) and here is a guide for [OBS.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJssyu6DNQsjQtdgKS-OwqKunkaMiEraagGMk3fmNJ4/edit) You can always reach out to Zoe in the [#digitalevents](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/984259876433829948) channel for help with recording but there is no guarantee that she will be free to record.

If you host your event on Zoom or Twitter Spaces, recording is easy peasy!

#### A Step-By-Step Guide

**STEP 1: Lock in the details and get on the calendar**

First, we need to get you on the schedule. We need a title, description of your event, location and a date/time at least 48 hours in advance. You can try to find a good time by taking a look at the [FWB Events Calendar](https://www.fwb.help/events) and finding an empty block of time. It is best to leave some buffer between each event to allow more folks to attend and avoid channel overlap. For locations, either tell us which discord voice channel you will be in, or include a zoom link or a twitter spaces link etc. Once you have all of the info, please fill out the [FWB Digital Events - Calendar Info Form](https://forms.gle/MaQ7RoEHvKN1Tj238) so that we can add the event to the events page, discord calendar and to the google calendar. You can also upload art or a flier here which adds some color to your post when it gets announced on the discord. (If you send along art, make sure it is less than 10 MB).

**STEP 2: Plan your event**

Events are best received when they are well thought out. Who are your guests? Do you want people to be able to participate in the conversation?

Do you want this event to be archived? If so, how are you going to record your event? Do you have guests who are not on the discord? If so, we will need to grant them access so we will need to know ahead of time.

**STEP 3: Show Time**

Make sure you have everything ready to go. Here are some things to think about:

- Getting outside guests into the discord. You will need to send their discord handles to Derek or Raihan ahead of time. Give them at least 24 hours of warning and be sure to follow up with them an hour before your event so we aren’t scrambling at the last minute.
- Recording your event. If you want your event to be archived, you are responsible for getting it recorded. If you know how to record from discord already, awesome! If not, you can use [Krisp Audio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) or OBS to do so. We highly recommend trying this out early!! It isn't trivial and you don't want to be troubleshooting this real time. HINT: Recording on zoom is SUPER easy, and you get video! So this is not a bad option. Twitter Spaces also records for you so that is another easy solution. When you are done recording your event, save it as either an mp3 (audio) or mp4 (video). The file must be named like this: YYYYMMDD_Event Name.mp3 You will include a link to this file when you submit to the archive (Step 4).
- Reporting real time attendance. You must give us a rough count of how many people attended your event in real time. It doesn’t need to be exact, but try to give us a ballpark number.
- Sound Quality. This one is HUGE!! While discord chaos is charming, it can also get annoying. We recommend that you and your guests do your calls with headphones on to optimize your mic sounds and limit risk of echos and discord sounds. It is also great if you can turn off your discord notification sounds and silence any other notifications on your computer and your phone. Also, pay attention to your audience and mute them or ask them to mute if they are making a lot of noise. If you need someone to help server mute, you can reach out to anyone in the AV Club to help, but usually a polite call out will do the trick.

**STEP 4: Submit to the archive and provide a post-event report.**

When you are done with your event, fill out this form: FWB Digital Events - Post-Event Report and Archive Submission. This form has to be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

This is where you can tell us your attendance and give us your recording to upload to the archive. You can give us a more detailed description of the event to be attached to the entry in the archive, think podcast show notes. You can also upload art here if you hadn’t added it in time to make it on the calendar.

### Thriftmas Event

#### Overview

Fashion is a core driver of innovation for our cities. With its strong connections to art and culture, recognising and celebrating that is an important part of our programming. With the fashion industry often seeming out of reach for many outsiders, the art of “picking” select pieces from high quality second hand stores feels a lot more accessible. For our Thirftmas event, we aim to host an experience that introduces the art of picking to our members in time to use it as a last minute christmas shopping trip. To add to the appeal of the event, we’ve enlisted the help of an industry professional who can guide us through the process. While Thriftmas is a catchy tagline for a Christmas event, this is a bit of programming that would still be suitable outside of the festive period.

#### Programming

The idea of shopping won’t be to everyone’s tastes, so pairing the experience with some kind of takeaways from it is key to making this a successful event. Researching into who some of the key players in your cities’ fashion circles is the key here. You want to find an endearing character ideally - somebody comfortable talking to our members on their experiences in their field. For our Thriftmas event, we looked into some of London’s independent fashion houses - those on the fringes of streetwear design and iconography. Identifying an individual who has knowledge of reselling vintage clothing was the aim here as the plan is to frequent some of their top destinations for finding good vintage pieces. In another situation you could apply this thinking towards an event that might be looking specifically at costume design, or period clothing - feel free to bend the narrative to suit your needs and program accordingly - identifying the individuals within your “sub-genre” of fashion is the main aim when considering the programming.

#### Programming Guiding Principles
- Collaborate with Governance and Operations on the Macrovision of what city needs
- The programming should create open and safe spaces for people to be themselves and allow for authentic connections.
- Our programming should tell the story of where we are located, highlight our cultural partners, values and what we want to share with our guests.
- Partners and Talent are our lifeblood, please treat accordingly.
- All types of people reflected in programming.
- Mix up locations we operate in. Our cities have plenty of hidden gems outside of the regular tried and tested haunts.
- Money is good, access is better.

#### Research  

Identifying the individual or organisation to be at the forefront of our event will be the key to success. Good research will get you there if you’re not already clued up in the fashion space. Some pointers are here for you on some of the starting points for identifying our guest host for the event.

Where do you start your search for your cities’ fashion stars?:
- Online blogs / magazines. A quick search on google for your city within the pages of publications like:
	- I-D Magazine
	- Hypebeast
	-  High Snobiety
	-  Vogue
	-  GQ
- Instagram - usually the best place to find and contact the people whose names pop up.
- Influencers. Search out your cities’ top fashion influencers via a google search.
- FWB’s “Selfies & Fits” Channel on Discord. We have our very own “Directory Of Drip” (I just made this up ) right at your disposal - go and make yourself known in there and ask our members what’s up.
- Ask a friend! We all have that one friend who is always on trend.

#### Approaching & Booking Talent

There are some pretty standard routes to take about booking talent for our event. Specifically to this fashion oriented event, I found that instagram was the best place to reach out. Naturally, the fashion world is highly focused on visuals and most of them are extremely active on Insta. Send a DM to let them know what you’re planning and ask if they’d be interested in potentially discussing the mechanics & business end on a call. Many of the people you speak to in the fashion world will be happy to deal directly with you - but if your event is focusing on high end fashion, it’s likely you’ll be redirected to an agent or P.A. who’ll want all the details from you before they give you an answer. Here’s a few guidelines on speaking directly with the talent, or dealing with an Agent / P.A. - there are two sub-sets here which outline how you’d go about that if the person in question is already in the DAO, or if they are not already a member:

- Talent operating inside the DAO & is a member.
	- Initial outreach via private Discord message.
	- Let them know you’re planning an event and have a date in mind.
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent / p.a.
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the talent can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the talent on call will help get the message across to the agent.
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with the talent present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the talent if they’ve said we can deal directly with them.
- Talent is not a member.
	- Find the talent on social media - twitter / instagram. See if they have an email contact for them or their agent. If they don’t have it public, send a DM where possible and ask who you can speak to about a possible booking.
	- Give an outline about the event dates and location.
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent.
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the talent can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the talent on call will help get the message across to the agent.
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with talent present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the talent if they’ve said we can deal directly with them.

#### Location Defined By The Expert.

For this kind of event, we’ll get the best out of it by allowing the talent to take us where they feel will be the best place to show them working their magic. In the sense of a thrift store, they’ll likely know exactly where to head to find the gems and you should be prepared to plan as best as you can around the locations they specify.

Once they’ve fed back to you on the area we’ll be heading to, have a look around online to find a suitable meeting point. With this trip being a shopping expedition, small group would be expected - finding a nearby coffee shop or pub is ideal to start so your guest can be introduced to your group.

It may also be advisable to have a place for after the shopping trip to have a drink afterwards - be sure to have a look on google maps at what is nearby and be sure to make room in the budget to cover a drink or two for the attendees and our guest host.

#### Budget - Things To Consider.
- Fees for the Talent / Picker’s time on the day.
- Expenses to cover drinks for members and our Talent.
- Any travel expenses agreed with the Talent / their Agent.

#### Timeline

##### 4 Weeks Out
- Decide Location
	- Research you city and choose a hot spot with an eclectic mix of suitable vintage/retro shops + bars for refreshments
- Book Talent
	- Outreach to the community first. If no luck, hit up a) established vintage stores b) top Depop sellers
- Estimate Costs
	- Once you’ve secured the talent,the venue and any food/drink packages, provide an estimation of the expenses and number of expected attendees in Airtable.

##### 3 Weeks Out
- Create Marketing Materials
	- Now that you’ve locked in the programming and the venue, you can put together a flyer using our approved marketing materials and brand kit.

##### 2 Weeks Out
- Finalize flyer and Gatekeeper RSVP page
- Get event on FWB Event Google Calendar
- Send Event to Editorial team for coverage in TLDR (if requested)
- Distribute RSVP link in proper Discord channels, including any temporary channels created for the specific conference
- Confirm any budget details or minimums with the venue to ensure expectations are aligned
- Send any deposit that is necessary to the booked host
- Print QR codes for POAPs if needed

##### 1 Week Out
- Manage the RSVP List (cut off RSVPs at a certain point if there is a limit, consider cutting off early if necessary to leave space for POC, women and/or FWB leadership who did not RSVP in time)
- Create POAP (if distributing)
- Confirm agenda with host, including stores being visited and any special discounts
- Discuss settlement/payment with venue to ensure that payment expectations are set

##### Day of Run of Show
- Finalize guest list and make sure everyone knows the ‘meet point’ and time, plus has a contact number in case of issues
- Contact any bars/venues being sued to host and confirm details and size of party
- As attendees arrive, greet them and deliver POAP QR code if printed
- Enjoy!
- “Settle up” (thoroughly review the bill, and other charges, and making remaining payments) the night of the event (or the next day if prearranged with the venue) so that there are no lingering issues with payment

##### Post
- Reconcile budget and upload all receipts to airtable
- Collect any content
- Conduct guestlist review/attendance rates for future intel
- Provide TL;DR to cityDAO’s at large with learnings and successes

#### Questions To Ask
- What story are we telling with our programming?
- What will people tell their friends about FWB?
- How is programming driving brand awareness?
- How can we use programming to make an impression?
- How is programming driving applications?
- How do we support the community?
- What larger events can we make?

### Art Crawl

#### Overview

When curating local experiences for our local FWB communities it is important to include a diverse range of experiences featuring:
- Sizes of venue
- Times of day
- Indoors vs Outdoors
- Weekend vs Weekday

The FWB NYC team arranged a Gallery Tour or “Art Crawl” through Chelsea in Downtown Manhattan, followed by a casual drink.

In the planning of this event we considered many different factors. For instance, each major city has a wide variety of art galleries:
- Massive, legendary stalwarts (like the Metropolitan in NYC)
- Avant-garde, smaller museums (across Downtown and Brooklyn in NYC).
- Paid ticket prices
- Free entry
- Older galleries with heritage
- Newer galleries that are up and coming

The FWB NYC team decided to focus on a cluster of galleries in an easily walkable part of Chelsea. This location was conveniently located and the galleries presented a range of contemporary exhibits.

When considering which galleries to visit we prioritized:
- Will the exhibits resonate with our members
- Do we have inroads to connect directly with leadership at the gallery
- Can those contacts give us special access or additional context that wouldn’t be possible without coming as an FWB group
- Does the gallery have an interest in web3/new technology?

We had been introduced to leadership at the PACE Gallery, and their interest in the web3 space reinforced our assumptions that a multi-stop “Art Crawl” through Chelsea, with a stop at PACE among other galleries, was a worthwhile endeavor.

We gathered in a public meeting point ahead of the tour. In order to meet up with members, who often times have never met in person, it is important to:
- Pick and easily recognizable meet up point
- Keep an eye on your Discord DMs (and text messages if you have circulated your phonenumber) to ensure anyone having trouble or running late is in the loop
- Share a video in the local events channel showing your surroundings

We gathered at the 26th St. entrance to the Highline and set off to tour five galleries: the Pace Gallery, the Flag Art Foundation, Dia. Chelsea and David Zwirner. We had other casual options on our itinerary that we ended up skipping as we preferred to spend more time at certain exhibits.

We teamed up with a cultural non-profit organization ([Index](https://www.index-space.org/)) to assist with gallery curation, outreach and design materials. When selecting a curatorial partner you must consider:
Does this partner have the right contacts to unlock experiences for the FWB group?
- Does this partner’s taste align in terms of gallery selection?
- Will the funds paid to the partner go toward a positive impact on the culture of your host city?
- Does this partner have a reputation as reliable and dependable?

Certain key galleries had been contacted by Index to allow them to arrange special access for the FWB group, including a private tour with a gallerist and discussions about the exhibits with associates.

When deciding how many people to include in this type of experience it is important to recognize the limitations and upside of your choice:
- What capacity is the “sweet spot” to show up as a true group, without overwhelming any of the locations you visit?
- What capacity allows for a group to travel well and nimbly, while also being large enough to be a worthwhile event?

The low capacity (in our case 20 attendees) was deliberate as it was the ideal group size to navigate within and between the gallery stops.

When dealing with a smaller capacity it is very important to be transparent and to set expectations as not everyone who is interested will be able to join. But in this case the smaller capacity was necessary to ensure the best possible experience for the group and to avoid overwhelming the galleries.

After the gallery tours we opened a tab at a local bar in order for members to meet, chat and share their experiences during the day. Though members had a chance to chat on the walks to and from the galleries it was clear that a casual hang after the tour was a welcome opportunity to get to know each other further. (See [Happy Hour SOP](https://github.com/zoefwb/wikisandbox/blob/main/Events.mdx#happy-hour) for best practices on casual social drinks).

#### Goals
We had gotten feedback from a number of Town Hall discussions in the nyc-voice channel that the NYC community was interested in exploring cultural art institutions across the city. We also wanted to experiment with daytime programming. Our members also wanted more lowkey moments where they could meet each other IRL.

FWB NYC leadership also wanted to showcase how FWB membership can unlock special experiences that would be otherwise inaccessible. In this case that meant access to leadership at the galleries and insight into the creative process of their curators.

#### Set Up
- Capacity: 20 FWB Members
- Tech: none
- Budget: $1500 (paid to Index for curation, gallery outreach, design), $200 for drinks
- Ticketing: RSVP via Google
- Marketing: Awareness was increased via Discord promotion in the NYC Local channels, as
well as Town Hall discussions and individual outreach
- Coverage
	- No broad marketing was needed as it was a smaller event with an intentionally limited capacity.
#### Timeline
Working backwards from the date, detail the steps and time for best event success 

##### Example
- 4 weeks
	- Outreach to curational partner if needed.
- 3 weeks
	- Select date for event, time, target list of galleries to visit, meeting spot, potential bars/lounges for casual drink if preferred. 
- 2 weeks
	- Gallery outreach to let arts institutions know that FWB group is visiting, allowing them to prepare point-person or other access for our group.
	- Begin awareness campaign on Discord, begin to build RSVP list. ● 1week
	- Ensure that attendees are aware of meet up plan, time and itinerary
	- Distribute map if created
- Week of Event
	- Check weather forecast to ensure any alterations to plan are anticipated
	- Locate meet up point on map and make sure plan route
	- Double check with galleries/venues that they are open (via website is adequate)
	- Double check itinerary with cultural partner or with internal team
	- If having a drink after the tour, find nearby watering hole and give them a call to make sure they’ll be open and that they can accommodate your group
- Run of Show
	- Send any necessary reminders/updates in Discord or email (cal invite, direct email), include your cell number in case folks are late and need to find the group mid-stride
	- Arrive at Meet Up point as early as feasible (30 minutes minimum)
	- Take reference photos/videos of your surrounding area to make you easy to spot, post photos with update and location to most appropriate
	- Consider bringing a funny FWB sign to hold or wear something that is easy to make you easy for FWB members to spot
	- Give a 10-15 minute grace period for stragglers, then set off together for your first visit
	- Allocate 30 minutes or so for each stop, checking in with appropriate contacts on a stop-by-stop basis
	- Make sure as the group moves that you everyone is comfortable, and check in after a few stops to get a vibe check on how many galleries the group would like to visit total
	- Take an epic photo or two along the way
	- If a bar hang is in the cards, make sure everyone knows the plan before you head over and make sure those who aren’t joining get a proper farewell

### Coworking

### Overview
Despite the promise of moon landings and a utopia free of email, business hours remain for many of us. In a distributed community, coming together is one of the many benefits. Coworking is a low friction solution to engage people personally while keeping productivity and creating more familiarity with the pursuits they define themselves by.

Though there are many professional opportunities that arise organically there is a tasteful approach to talking about “work stuff”. FWB in spirit is a fairly “shill-free” zone. Coworking is a respectable way of coming together around professional topics and creating new value from our value-aligned group.

There is an ongoing desire for FWB members to connect personally, sharing space amongst other members opens the door for deeper connection and makes the workday less boring.

### Goals

When planning a coworking event, understand that these coworking scenarios may be exciting for some members as entertainment, adventure, and dining. These events afford an opportunity to:
- Connect with members IRL
- Share a space with people who may share passions
- Explore new spaces that can spark inspiration
- Share projects, status, needs, resources, and opportunities
- Get to know your fellow members in a casual “hang” environment

Over time FWB will develop affiliate relationships with spaces in cities and create spaces for gathering, working, and community in the future.

### Set-Up

When collaborating with an existing coworking space, or taking over a rentable space, it is important to focus on many details leading up to the event to ensure a valuable experience for FWB members.
- Set up a designated FWB area for coworking ahead of time
- Set expectations around the amount of FWB guests and how to handle the admin of welcoming/greeting those guests and directing them to the coworking zone
- Have the WIFI password printed out and readily available to FWB guests
- Make sure there is ample seating for FWB guests and other amenities (pens, paper, etc) that may be necessary for collaboration and work session
- If there are any “share backs” or presentations, coordinate with the venue (or arrange for your own group) any AV needs
- Food & Beverage
	- If the venue charges for food or drink, find out if you can run a tab and put down a credit card in advance
	- If F&B is complimentary, enjoy
	- If there is no food and drink, source F&B from a nearby independent restaurant or plan a time for everyone to gather for a meal/snack/drink

### Venue & Size
When selecting a venue you must consider a number of factors:
- Is this location convenient for many FWB members based on where they typically live/work?
- If you are working with an existing workspace, is there a good vibe? Does this company share the values of FWB?
- Is there enough “private space” for the FWB coworking session to feel intimate enough for open conversations and collaborations?
- Does the venue have proper WIFI and other technical needs?
- Do the open hours of this space make sense for your FWB local community?
- Avoid fluorescent light by all means necessary

It is also important to consider the type of space ideal for your event. Types of Workspace Options:
- FWB Member “Day Job” Offices (if space allows members can use their day-to-day offices to offer up space to the FWB community)
- Existing “blue chip” co-working spaces (Neuehouse, Soho House, Industrious) (FWB member sponsor likely needed)
- Existing tech/web3 hubs (LaunchHouse, Defiant)
- Working Spaces within Apartment Buildings or Other Residential Options (buildings increasingly have a workspace that allows rentals)

### Ticketing & RSVP
You need to create the promotional materials and registration for your event. All FWB events will utilize the Gatekeeper platform for RSVPs. This can host all your event details and utilize token gated, Web3 RSVP system:
- Create the event invitation using the Canva templates for [square fliers](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview) and [instagram stories](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)
- Upload your event and details to [Gatekeeper](https://gatekeep.it/) 
- Have your Operations counterpart proof the work
- Test drive the platform and run through the process
- Deploy RSVP to the community

If applicable and exciting for the venue, teach them to use the Gatekeeper app. If not, work with the host venue to identify FWB members.

### Marketing & Promotion

By crowdsourcing a time and date, you’ve engaged the crowd to co-author the experience. Now it’s time to publish and build anticipation. Steps ahead:
- Create an invite and RSVP on the Gatekeeper app
- Make sure to leave 10% of seating available to the very last minute
	- Ex. if there are 20 seats at a table, only publish 18 for RSVP, the last two are reserved
- Send reminders in the timelines below 50/50 the share of voice with promoting the event with your counterpart
- Publish a Co-Working Event with a minimum of 7 days notice
	- Share with FWB editorial / social team to incorporate in weekly comms
	- Craft an @everyone message on the City channel
	- Keep it tidy using formats to bold the date, time, address
- Drop the link daily with a reminder to RSVP for those that may have missed the post
- On event day, make sure DMs are open for members of the server
- Send a final reminder in the morning
- Once on-site, send a photo to the #channel with detail or ambiance of the venue
- Use the channel for any attendance updates

### Timeline
#### 10 - 14 DAYS

### Dinner 
#### Overview

he table is one of the most important technologies created in the history of civilization. Entertaining a group with dining is one of the most extravagant purchases one can make. There are a tremendous amount of resources required for a warm plate of well prepared food to reach a table for a group of people.
Keeping this in mind, almost nothing can replace the experience of sharing a meal with a friend,, family, lover, colleague or fellow crypto stranger from the metaverse.
#### Goals
The difference between a meaningful dining experience and a forgettable dinner is the host’s ability to grasp and illuminate the many elements that create the meal. The ingredients, the ideas, the people, accommodations, decor, etc...

When you’re creating a dining experience, consider the following as some important indicators of success:
- Creating an experience that feels connected to the guests, the kitchen, and the environment
- Stimulating senses with product and ambiance to literally imprint a memory
- Recognizing the hosts, owners, staff, cooks, farmers, and natural resources in the process
- Offering social, soulful, and nutritional restoration that gives lasting value to a community
- Showing care

#### Programming
Programming dining events is not that dissimilar from curating art, music, fashion, or otherwise. They all leverage talent, prestige, context, culture, provenance, and instinct to guide our decision making.
However, producing group dining requires precision. Matters of exceedingly high costs of goods, individual dietary restrictions, public health and safety, and a further litany of reasons make it slightly more complicated than most other event types.
In short, if you are unfamiliar with booking dining events, pay close attention to the SOP or call upon an expert in your community for guidance:
- Collaborate with Governance and Operations on the macro-objectives of the City
	- Remain aligned and additive to the strategy of the local membership
- Determine the viability and desirability of a dining occasion
	- Is it organic to the local membership?
	- Do we have the resources to produce this experience meaningfully?
	- Does this serve members of all ages, abilities, and reasonable preferences?
- Safety first when hosting the consumption of food and drink
	- Always consider accessibility, geography, transportation, and security
	- Never serve alcohol to a minor
	- Always play the host by observing and taking responsibility for the occasion
	- Never promote the overconsumption of alcohol
	- Always ask the audience to provide any life threatening allergies to you directly and communicate with the Chef / restaurant to ensure there is no mistake

#### SETUP
##### Determine an Experience

FWB Cities recommends three styles of dining events for our community:
- Culinary Experiences (Small)
	- This is the epicurean celebration of food and it’s process, centering the conversation on the dining experience itself with a fully seated and detailed service of food, drink, and accoutrement
- Group Dining (Medium)
	- The most typical dining event for communion exists in restaurants, residences, or pop up experiences with less choreography and cerebral food and drink service in favor of feeding friends together. Group dining is often served family style, plattered, potluck, or as a buffet. Rarely does Group Dining make sense with individual guest orders.
- Local Flavor (Large)
	- These are non-exclusive dining destinations that can accommodate the masses. Local flavor is all about quick service and volume. Think beer halls, wine gardens, food courts, pizzerias, taquerias, sandwich shops, coffee shops, curry shops, and more... These are by nature, community establishments and have the infrastructure to host large groups on demand.

In general, dining events can be elaborate and expensive, or informal and communal. To organize pricing and selections, the table below is relevant to the US but is also decent for most developed nations currency exchange:
- Luxury: >$200pp + tax + gratuity (25%) + additional customization
- Premium: $100pp + tax + gratuity (20%)
- Banquet: $50pp + tax + gratuity (15%)
- Casual: $25pp + tax + gratuity (10%)
- Economical: <$25pp + tax

##### Event Examples :
- (SMALL / PREMIUM CULINARY EXPERIENCE) FWB NYC is hosting a recruitment dinner for our most active members that have onboarded new memberships, it will be a premium culinary experience for 12 guests at Porcelain in Ridgewood, around $2400 from the monthly budget to net 12 new members from this group.
- (MEDIUM / CASUAL GROUP DINING) FWB LA is doing a casual dinner party for 30 people at Highly Likely Cafe with member Chef Kat Turner who is gifting her space and charging $3000 all in for the private dinner, followed by cocktails for 30 more members.
- (LARGE / ECONOMICAL LOCAL FLAVOR) FWB MIAMI is hosting a day party to celebrate the chapter launch and approval of 250 new memberships in Season 5. Sweet Beach can accommodate a walkup BBQ sandwich station for 300 guests at $25 per person.

Choosing an event day is tricky. Strong organizers know when to crowdsource answers and source answers for the crowd. Over time, this will become more predictive and intuitive. In the earlier stages, we recommend crowdsourcing broad schedules. Once you’ve selected the venue, you should crowdsource the event date:
- Check calendars for holidays that may indicate members traveling out of town
- Choose two date options and offer a vote with Reactions (Discord)
- Don’t overcomplicate, just suggest a couple of date options and go with the higher tally

##### Event Hours
Each dining event is going to be unique but three hours is a good rule of thumb. Some things
to remember:
- Set up and breakdown can take a few hours on each side of the event
- Communication with your guests will take a few hours on each side of the event
- 90 minutes is a good time limit for seating, after that it can get boring for the guest
- Allow 30 minutes for guest arrivals
- Allow an hour for guests to mingle to follow

When booking a meal period, use your instinct on the local geography and understand the general availability of the membership. Consider the following:
- What’s the traffic in your local area?
- Is there parking near the venue?
- Will people be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the start time?

Pro-tips for keeping people on time:
- Share a Google calendar invite with the reminders turned on
- Push messaging in local channels around strict seating times
- Limit capacity of every event and make sure there is always demand for the next

##### Venue & Size
Leads should possess a working knowledge of relevant venues in the city to host experiences. This includes food and drink establishments in varying neighborhoods of the City they lead. Use your best judgement to pick the vibe, here’s some standards:
- Best to have indoor and outdoor areas
- Mom and pop / independently owned business (ie. non-chain restaurant or establishment)
- Quality ambience free of fluorescent lights, offensive music, or questionable authenticity
- Climate control for heating / cooling / coverage in inclement weather
- An area that feels private or semi-private to the group
- An ambient volume or volume control that allows people to hear one another speak
- If outdoors, a floor to move on wheels or heels
- Parking accessible within a safe distance
- Bonus points for womxn / LGBTQ+ / POC owned

##### Booking an Establishment
- Choose a location in the city that fits the above
- Visit the venue for a bite and a chance to get a vibe
- Assess the F&B offering to accommodate common dining restrictions (GF, DF, V, VEG)
- If it’s a fit and feeling, ask for a manager on duty and tell them you’d like to host an event
- Ask the number of guests they can accommodate for group dining
- Visit any private or semi-private for dining
- Find out if you can play your own music
- If it seems easy, it will be
- If it seems complicated, it will be
- Get the contact information and shake hands
- Follow up with a correspondence with the following in mind:
	- For a Dining Experience: you’ll likely return to the venue or need a call / meeting to plan
	- For Group Dining: ask for prix fixe or family style menus they offer
	- For Local Flavor events: confirm the hours of operation on your intended eventday
- Make sure there is room to reduce or increase capacity 20% of seats available
- Ask for their availability for two dates in the weeks to follow
- Return to the #channel and propose the two dates for Reaction vote
- Take the prevailing vote and confirm the date with the venue
- Make a deposit if required

##### Producing a Dining Event (Off SIte Dining)
When hosting a dinner at a residential, private, or non-commercial space, there are an endless array of variables to consider. This is a practical guide to making the most of your dining event:
- What makes the venue more special than the convenience of an establishment?
- If that’s hard to answer, go to an establishment. If that’s easy, continue on...
- Does the venue meet the same criteria as the restaurant selection?
- Is the point of contact the final decision maker, owner, or operator?
- If yes, great. If not, find out who it is and be clear about the expectation. Make sure they approve.
- Visit the venue prior to event, take tons of photos of all areas and document the condition
- Communicate with the host or manager to confirm:
	- The venue is large enough to accommodate the guests
	- You can access the venue 3+ hours in advance of the event to prepare
	- The venue is clean for the guests arrival
	- The space is in working order (lights, restrooms, sound, parking)
	- If you are cooking in the venue, take notes on the following;
		- Gas, electric and plumbing are in working order
		- The heavy cooking equipment you can use
		- The pots, pans, and cooking utensils you can use
		- The cleaning supplies you can use
		- Whatever you can not use, you will bring
	- For service:
		- Count the number of plates, platters, silverware, and glassware inventory
		- If enough for the event, confirm you can use all of it
		- If not, order tossware / compostables or pickup at a party supply store
		- Make sure the refrigeration and freezer can be emptied in advance
		- If not, bring a cooler and ice bucket
- Type up your notes and confirm on email
- Once the date is confirmed with the host, buy event insurance from EventHelper.com
- Share the certificate issued with the host for peace of mind for all
- Order some handy items in advance:
	- Wine key and opener
	- Blue painters tape / labels and a Sharpie
	- 6 pack of toilet paper
	- 6 rolls paper towels
	- Cutting board and knife
	- Lighter
	- Votive candles

### Diversity in Programming

#### Overview
Crypto, as with many communities founded in financial instruments, actively discriminates against vast portions of our society. The perception of white male dominated communities is not only a phenomenon NFT NYC has to deal with on the guest lists, but also our humble and treasured DAO, FWB.

Membership is still heavily skewed in the wrong direction and there is significant under representation across gender, race, orientation & outlook.

Combatting this is being achieved on a DAO membership level, where measures are being put in place to promote successful applicants from minority groups faster and more effectively. However, to turbo charge our efforts we need to challenge ourselves on a city level to create inbound membership leads from diverse backgrounds.

Note - there are many great organizations out there that need support - instead of spinning up own initiatives, see if there is a group we can partner with first.

#### FWB Cities ambition
1. Each event is a microcosm of the community we want to build & the programming of each event should be reflective of that.
2. Actively promote a diversity agenda which all DAO members can contribute to (important not to exclude the existing community
3. Create events and activity which benefits exiting members by introducing fresh perspective
4. Engage non-DAO communities to create an influx of diverse new applicants
5. Onboard new members with our inclusive principals made clear from day 1

#### Immediate hacks
- Audit your existing FWB city DAO community, you may find you are better represented than you think. Speak to your group and understand who you’ve at your disposal.
- Review existing programming ideas and understand how people and talent are participating. Actively program a diverse lineup where you can; from DJs to chefs, and panel speakers to photographers.
- Identify power diversity movements at the intersection of culture in your city. Working with established and authoritative communities with an existing membership will be the way to unlock the faster membership growth for the DAO
   
#### Programming Route A - education
_TACKLING: the skills gaps preventing groups engaging with crypto for the first time_

##### IDEA 1: ‘Friends Who Onboard - an evening of wallet creation and NFT minting’
- Identify a group who would be interested in being softly introduced to crypto. Working with the group leaders to offer FWB scholarships (check with cityDAO gov & ops if available) and membership opportunities 
- Identify someone within the DAO capable of teaching the basics of wallet setup for the first time, or reach out to #partnerships and involve Ledger/Metamask Createaninformallearningenvironmentatalocalmembersclub/bar/co-workspace
- Potentially introduce a NFT creator from the DAO, allowing for a more engaged learning session by conducting an in-person mint Amplifywithsuitablesponsorstoboostexperienceandcreatecontent+brandingto reinforce FWB as the opportunity creator

Budget ballpark: $500 to $2,500 Attendance expectations: 15 to 60

##### IDEA 2: ‘Friends With Opinions - a panel discussion on women/BAME/LGBTQ+ in crypto’

- Front up and tackle the issue head on. Find passionate speakers and opinion leaders from within the crypto community who can ignite discussion and create a welcoming platform which positions FWB as the catalyst for change
- Moderator should be curated fromthe FWB DAO where possible
- Opportunity to host and create digitally, via Discord or Twitterspaces if talent/participants are international
- Backup talk with outreach to all attendees, offering onboarding opportunities
- 
Budget ballpark: $1,500 to $4,000 Attendance expectations: 30 to 80

#### Programming route B - culture
TACKLING: our communities inhibitions to explore culture beyond our limited field of view

FWB events don’t mandate a purpose. We exist for culture’s sake, so let’s look to enrich our DAO members whilst broadening our impact and appeal within underrepresented communities.

From dance to art, and photography to mixology; identify ways to broaden the experiences of our DAO. In doing so, find ways to onboard and achieve the FWB cityDAo ambitions.

#### Partnership creation
Leveraging existing communities to boost diversity if DAO membership lacks immediate connections.

### Happy Hour

#### Overview

The year was 2020 and the earliest days of FWB. The world was quarantined in the Covid pandemic. We were thirsty for connection and parched from the boredom.

It was only a matter of time before we’d adapt our ubiquitous Zoom video calls to revive the promise of Happy Hour.
As we reorient ourselves toward the sidewalk discount bar specials of yesteryear, FWB will bring our digitally connected community back to public life in the pubs and patios to commiserate on our daily grind, gossip amongst the townsfolk, and sipple our way to tipsy bonds that will last a lifetime... or at least until 7pm.

#### Goals

The purpose of the happy hour is to create a low stakes, familiar occasion as a recurring touchpoint in the community to meet offline. This nearly no-production event takes advantage of existing public hosting spaces to minimize costs and maximize our time together. Each happy hour event can consider the following goals:

- Feels organic, inviting, and simple for the guest
- Creates interaction amongst the community with face to face encounters
- Provides continuity in conversations that began online

#### Programming

Our members are dynamic. This occasion is not. The happy hour is a space for sodium and social restoration. It requires the absence of content to maximize its potential.

In our happy hour programming, there shall be no exhibition, no brand presentation, no strong point of view, and no purpose other than the gathering of the people in a public space. It would be unceremonious to create a ceremony.
In short, an FWB Happy Hour should be as predictable as one could imagine.
- Collaborate with Governance and Operations on the macro-objectives of the City
	- Remain aligned and additive to the strategy of the local membership
- Determine the viability and desirability of a Happy Hour occasion ○ Is it organic to the local membership?
	-  Does this serve members of all ages, abilities, and reasonable preference?
- Safety first when hosting the consumption of alcohol
	- Always consider accessibility, geography, transportation, and security
	-  Never serve alcohol to a minor
	-  Always play the host by observing and taking responsibility for the occasion
	-  Never promote the overconsumption of alcohol

#### Venue & Size

Leads should possess a working knowledge of relevant venues in the city to host experiences. This includes food and drink establishments in varying neighborhoods of the City they lead. Use your best judgement to pick the vibe, here’s some standards:
- Best to have indoor and outdoor areas
- Mom and pop / independently owned business (ie. non-chain restaurant)
- Quality ambience free of fluorescent lights, offensive music, or questionable authenticity
- Climate control for heating / cooling / coverage in inclement weather
- When possible, choose a venue that is womxn / LGBTQ+ / POC owned

Happy hour should be an organic booking. We do not need to book private spaces. To book a happy hour event for your group without incurring additional private rental fees, begin with the following:
- Choose a location in the city that fits the above
- Go there for a happy hour prior to the event
- Meet a manager on duty, tell them you’d like to host an informal meetup at their happy hour
- If it sounds easy, it will be
- If it sounds complicated, it will be
- Get the contact information and shake hands
- Follow up by text or email with the venue about guest count, potential date, and next steps needed
- Do not talk about cryptocurrency

When booking the venue, there are a few key things to make it easiest for all involved:
- You like the place and want to bring business
- The meetup is non-exclusive and can simply be a small section reserved
- There will be a tab with a limit for your group, it will be settled on a single card
- You don’t require special accommodation or arrangements beyond typical daily operations
= Use text messages with venue managers whenever possible, email is a black hole in venues

**Choosing an event day is tricky.** Strong organizers know when to crowdsource answers and source answers for the crowd. Over time, this will become more predictive and intuitive. In the earlier stages, we recommend crowdsourcing broad schedules. Once you’ve selected the venue, you should crowdsource the event date:
- Check calendars for holidays that may indicate members traveling out of town
- Choose two date options and offer a vote with Reactions (Discord)
- Don’t overcomplicate, just suggest a couple of date options and go with the higher tally

#### Ticketing/RSVP

You need to create the promotional materials and registration for your event. All FWB events will utilize the Gatekeeper platform for RSVPs. This can host all your event details and utilize token gated, Web3 RSVP system:
- Create the event invitation using the Canva templates for [square fliers](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview) and [instagram stories](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)
- Upload your event and details to the Gatekeeper (https://gatekeep.it/)
- Have your Operations counterpart proof the work
- Test drive the platform and run through the process

#### Marketing & Promotion

By crowdsourcing a time and date, you’ve engaged the crowd to co-author the experience. Now it’s time to publish and build anticipation. Steps ahead:
- 50/50 the share of voice with promoting the event with your counterpart
- Publish a Cocktail / Happy Hour event with (up to) 7 days notice
	- Share with FWB editorial / social team to incorporate in weekly comms
	- Craft an @everyone message on the City channel
	- Keep it tidy using formats to bold the date, time, address
- Drop the link daily with a reminder to RSVP for those that may have missed the post
- On event day, make sure DMs are open for members of the server
- Send a final reminder in the morning
- Once on site, send a photo to the #channel with a detail or ambiance of the venue
- Use the channel for any attendance updates

#### Timeline

### Movie Night

#### Overview

FWB is a cultural epicenter of the internet. Though our community is quite literally coordinated around a crypto asset, it is our diverse artistic interests and backgrounds that unite our members and ultimately power the creative influence we’ve fostered since FWB’s inception.

The overall goal of Cities is to distribute the larger DAO’s vision and values into a physical realm and so its important that our programming reflects these broader interests outside crypto.

Though we may be known for the power that is #NFT-Gen-Chat and #Trading-Crypto its the #TV-And-Movies and #Filmmakers channels that members know they can always turn to for thoughtful discussions around something they recently saw or to just get a solid recommendation for a night in on the couch.

More broadly, there is always an ongoing interest from members to connect and get to know each other on a deeper level and sometimes there’s no better medium for a shared experience than cinema to spark meaningful conversation, connection, insight, inspiration with others.

#### Goals
In polling the community for different programming areas of interest, there has been an overwhelming response to FWB Movie Nights. This proves a clear interest in cinema which provides us with a low touch/stakes engagement touchpoint with virtually zero production needed. This minimizes costs so we can maximize our monthly budget and install an easy, repeatable event that members look forward to.
Each Movie Night will aim to hit on the following goals:
- Creates a causal interaction amongst the community with face to face encounters
- Provides an injection of culture for members to participate in together
- Can serve as a conversation starter that can live on in the Discord channel
- Potentially sparks a new editorial angle for film reviews by FWB

#### Venues to Consider
Though it may not be possible for each city, consider choosing a venue that offers theater dining. This gives us the opportunity to combine a Movie Night with a Happy Hour where members can order food and beverages to enjoy with their viewing. With this, based on your projected monthly budget, you can consider comping the F&B for the screening or having members purchase at their discretion. When possible, try to choose an independent theater or arts non profit theater rather than a major chain.

Some suggestions for venues include:
NYC:
- [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com/nyc)
- [Metrograph](https://metrograph.com)
- [Nitehawk Cinema](https://nitehawkcinema.com)

LA: 
- [Alamo Drafthouse](https://drafthouse.com/los-angeles)
- [AMC Sunset](https://www.amctheatres.com/movie-theatres/los-angeles/amc-sunset-5)
- [Los Feliz 3](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=los+feliz+3&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

London:
- [One Aldwych](https://www.onealdwych.com/theatre/)
- [The Prince Charles Cinema](https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/Home)
- [The Electric](https://www.electriccinema.co.uk)
- [Picturehouse](http://www.picturehouse.com)

#### Coordination
- Determine interest from community: This is to get a sense of availability and numbers which will help determine whether 1 or 2 theaters will be needed
- Select Theater Venue: Inquire with the box office and pick a date to rent out full theater
- Community Vote on Film: Run a poll in the local Discord channel to let the community take part in choosing the film that month.
- Depending on your theater venue, this will either be a current release or you can get creative and create an overarching theme for each month with an older film that gets screened
	- See [Brain Dead Studio’s Movie Programming Strategy](https://studios.wearebraindead.com/screening/0) by way of example

### Satellite Event at a Conference

#### Overview

Conferences play an important role in the business world, including the arts and technology spaces where many of FWB’s members focus their work and passion.

Though conferences have a tremendous amount of programming, usually accessible only to those who have purchased an “official” badge or other passes, key conferences such as Art Basel, SXSW, CES, and more recently NFT.NYC and others also feature unofficial “satellite events”.

These events come in many shapes and sizes but serve the overarching purpose of offering experiences to those who are official badge holders of an event, or those who traveled or local who want to participate in the discourse and vibe of a conference to network, party, and learn without having to attend the conference itself.

This SOP will unpack the strategy and execution of producing a Satellite Event at a Conference, through the lens of an NFT.NYC Satellite Event which was thrown in NYC in November 2021.

The first step is deciding whether a conference is a strong candidate for an FWB Satellite Event. When weighing this thought you should consider:
- Is the conference in a city with a strong FWB presence?
- Will FWB members be traveling in for the conference?
- Does the conference content/mission align with FWB values?
- Is FWB participating in the conference in an official capacity?

#### Goals
Conferences themselves offer a variety of activities and touchpoints for attendees. Therefore you must have a clear idea of what you want to get from a satellite conference event for FWB members.

Goals for the NFT.NYC satellite Happy Hour event included:
- Maximizing FWB presence at an influential conference
- Giving FWB members an intimate space to gather and meet one another in a controlled atmosphere (vs the “party” forward events found elsewhere throughout the week)
-  Allowing FWB members to share their plans for the rest of the conference in order to bring the Discord conversation (which seemed overwhelming) into a physical forum
- Having an earlier event so that it would be a “staging area” of sorts where groups of FWB members could head to other events throughout the night (and rest of the week) together, vs individually navigating the conference
- Creating space for FWB members to connect on a personal level (as this was the first NYC Local event)
- Producing an additional touchpoint for those who traveled to NYC to collect in one space that was all FWB members in a mostly “scattered” week
- Showcase the FWB vibe via great music, food, drinks in a beautiful, hidden gem of a space

#### Venue & Size
Most conferences will be centralized in a specific part of a city, with a dedicated check-in spot and a venue (sometimes a hotel, convention center, or other large venues) as the hub for their programming. Keep in mind that conferences themselves may have smaller, more intimate events. It is important to carve out your own lane for your event to the best of your ability.

When selecting a venue there are many factors to consider:
- Based on travelers and local community size, is the venue appropriately sized for your expected turnout?
- Is the venue accessible to both the official conference events, but also other satellite events that FWB members are likely to attend?
- Does the venue offer cultural value to your city?
- Does the venue have the proper technical equipment, hospitality components, seating, and other amenities necessary for a successful event?
- Is the venue being utilized for other events during the conference? This could either be a positive or a negative of course.

Keep in mind that it is common for attendees to go to many events in one night during a conference, so these questions are key to your event’s success.

Venues tend to book up quickly so give yourself ample time (up to 4-5 months in advance for a conference like SXSW).

#### Ticketing & RSVP

Conference events are competing for a very specific audience in a crowded event market and event RSVPs (and satellite events in particular) are vulnerable to no-shows. You need to be meticulous about creating an engaging event, with a seamless RSVP process and solid follow-through on reminders/confirmations.

Conferences are always filled with freeloaders who may try to crash your party! Leveraging our Gatekeeper product, this should be fairly easy to navigate.

Even with Gatekeeper, it’s still always recommended to give the door operator an approved attendee list. Lastly, if possible, it’s always a good idea to send the approved list a note a day or so before the event and double-confirm their attendance.

## Marketing & Promotion

Depending on the size of the venue you chose and the size of the conference, marketing and promoting the event heavily and early can deter other event organizers from creating conflicting events. The downside to this approach is that you may get a high amount of RSVPs who may end up going elsewhere. This is why managing your attendee list like a hawk is critical.

We suggest to research current marketing trends for best outcomes.

In some instances, the official conference happening during your satellite event may be open to promoting your event. Others may find a satellite event to be unwelcome (though not unexpected!) It is up to your judgment whether to engage with the main conference. It is often best not to “poke the bear”.

#### Timeline

##### 4 Weeks Out
- Book Venue
	- Given the increased demand, securing a venue as early as possible will prevent headaches down the line. For certain conferences, you will need more lead time. Confirm that the space you booked is appropriate for your target capacity. 
- Book Talent
	- Again, it’s possible that the talent you’re looking to source may also be on the radar for other event organizers for the same conference. While this may be beneficial for the talent should the times of the events differ, it can cause problems if there are timing conflicts.
- Estimate Costs
	- Once you’ve secured the talent, the venue, and any food/drink packages, provide an estimation of the expenses and number of expected attendees in Airtable.

##### 3 Weeks Out
- Create Marketing Materials
	- Now that you’ve locked in the programming and the venue, you can put together a flyer using our approved marketing materials and brand kit.
- Venue Walkthrough
	- Make sure to discuss staffing, any tech needs, menu, drinks, any type of open bar arrangement, and make sure to have it all in writing so there is no misalignment in terms of expectations
- Keep an eye on other events as they pop up to know your competition

##### 2 Weeks Out
- Finalize flyer and Gatekeeper RSVP page
- Get event on FWB Event Google Calendar
- Send Event to Editorial team for coverage in TLDR (if requested)
- Distribute RSVP link in proper Discord channels, including any temporary channels created for the specific conference
- Confirm any budget details or minimums with the venue to ensure expectations are aligned
- Send any deposit that is necessary to hold the venue
- Print QR codes for POAPs if needed

#### 1 Week Out
- Manage the RSVP List (cut off RSVPs at a certain point if there is a venue limit, consider cutting off early if necessary to leave space for POC, women, and/or FWB leadership who did not RSVP in time)
- Create POAP (if distributing)
- Send music playlist (if there is no DJ) to the venue at least 4 hours before doors to ensure quality music vibes
- Confirm photographer or divvy up content creation responsibilities with the local team
- Discuss settlement/payment with the venue to ensure that payment expectations are set

##### Day of Run of Show
- Finalize guest list and make sure venue has your guest list, along with any details on whether attendees are allowed a +1 or other details, at least 3 hours prior to doors opening
- Welcome the point person from the venue and introduce yourself and any other team members to the venue staff
- Arrive at least 1 hour early at the venue to ensure there are no issues
- At least 1 hour before doors do a full venue walkthrough including the entrance and check-in points
- Check with the venue to make sure you are on the same page about the hours of the event and any schedule of food, or other arrangements
- Make sure your music source is available and charged
- Do a tech check for any AV or music equipment
- Make sure music is on to create a vibe at least 10 minutes before doors open
- If there are any bar details that need to be discussed with the venue (open bar, bar minimum, drink sponsors, or specials) double-check the details the day of with the staff of the venue
- As attendees arrive, greet them and deliver POAP QR code if printed
- Even at an open bar, do not get intoxicated
- “Settle up” (thoroughly review the bill, and other charges, and make remaining payments) the night of the event (or the next day if prearranged with the venue) so that there are no lingering issues with payment

### Sourcing Talent From Your Discord Community

#### Overview

The FWB’s application team is constantly working hard, evaluating new applicants, and ensuring new members are culturally and value-aligned. Given the nature of our culture-first community, many of our members are tremendously talented in all types of disciplines. For example, in New York, we currently have about 20 producers/DJs in the local community.

Sourcing local FWB talent for local FWB events is a great way to drive engagement and bring the community closer together. However, it’s not always easy to find talent within our Discord channel. This is due to a number of challenges:
- Use of pseudo, or fully-anonymous names
- Use of avatars (profile pictures) from their favorite NFT collections instead of a profile photo
- Lack of contact information (disregard for suggest Twitter handle addition to FWB nickname
- Lack of ongoing visibility in Discord over time due to the platform’s ephemeral nature

In this SOP, we’ll discuss how we can use “soft polls” in Discord to find talent, and how to leverage that talent into an event. In this example, we’ll use our “FWBxNYC: DJ Takeover” night, which featured 10 locally-sourced DJs over a 4-hour window.

#### Coordinating a Lineup
While the product team is hard at work building a member directory, which will make this process significantly easier, the directory is currently not yet live at the time of writing this, nor was it live at the time of this event. As a result, we leveraged what is referred to as “soft polls” to source talent.

#### Soft Poll: Blanket Approach
We started with a broader blanket-style approach to try and get some optics in the community. As you can see below, we used emoji responses as a way to poll our community, where different emoji represented different skills.

![Discord1](https://github.com/zoefwb/wikisandbox/blob/main/Ex1.png)

#### RSVP & Data Collection

After you have an idea of how the community could contribute you can use [Gatekeeper](https://fwb.mirror.xyz/XU5_RYsow8fDbbckryr2snNyfrMV8HTJ0N39Cjkfy3s) to collect further data and RSVPs for the event. Gatekeeper is FWB’s homegrown token-accessible RSVP portal that can detect the amount of FWB (or any other crypto) held in the wallet of someone attempting to RSVP to an event, therefore ensuring that those who attend have the correct tokens held to gain entrance.
Gatekeeper can also collect other information necessary for the event check-in process:
- Email address (so we could send around a calendar invite)
- RSVP for the event (yes or no)
- Name (for door operator)
- Are you bringing a plus-one? If so, what is their name?
 
Since we were specifically looking for DJs for our event, we added one additional question: “Are you a DJ?” If they selected yes, they were then brought to a second form, where we prompted for:
- Do you want to mix live for this event?
- Do you want to mix live for future events?
- What is your discord name?
- Where do you post your music? Please provide a link.
- Do you have your own equipment?

#### Organizing the Line-Up
Sometimes venues will provide guidance on what kind of music they’d prefer to be played. For this event, we didn’t have any such restrictions.

We had 10 DJs respond who wanted to spin. Though we trust our community it is important to vet any talent before inviting them to join an FWB event to ensure quality and vibe.
When vetting talent it is important to consider:
- Experience
- Quality of any links or work references
- Dependability/reliability (will they show up?)
- Cost to book (if any)
- Style/format

Once we had vetted the DJ applicants we decided on a lineup that went from more mellow, soulful tunes to more aggressive, electronic music as the night went on in order to create the best “flow”.

#### Soft Poll: Line-Up
Once we had a proposed lineup, we then took the lineup back to a soft poll in Discord. In this instance, we used the poll to verify that the set times worked for the DJs. See below.

![Discord2](https://github.com/zoefwb/wikisandbox/blob/main/Ex2.png)

You can see here that we also prompted for social media links, which we included in the Google Calendar invite in order to give some well-deserved exposure to our talent.

**Important:** You must always reach out to the venue and get a rundown of what equipment they have. Some equipment requires a laptop, while others just need a USB (which is typically preferred by DJs). It’s important that you let your DJs know what equipment they will be mixing on ahead of time so they can prepare accordingly.

#### Finalizing the Calendar Invite & Providing Credit

As noted, it’s in good taste to leverage your power as a local leader to provide as much exposure to the DJs as possible.
One way to do that is to provide links to each artist’s preferred social media or otherwise website. You can see below that we included links for each of the artists in the Google Calendar invite (along with some funky copy to make it fun). It’s also always a good habit to include your cell phone number as last-minute things do come up.

![Discord3](https://github.com/zoefwb/wikisandbox/blob/main/Ex3.png)

Further, while we didn’t source a professional photographer, we did take some photos of the event and DJs playing, which some of them used on their own socials. We posted all of the photos in the Discord channel, but I ended up editing a few and throwing them up on my social page as well. See [here](https://twitter.com/0xbasil/status/1462820473604124674) (they actually came up pretty good!)
