## Event Keys

Event Keys was born out of a need to further decentralize our IRL event programming and expand our reach beyond the diversity of events coming from our Cities subDAOs (formerly LA, New York, and London).

Event Keys create city-specific experiences for the FWB community to come together locally, with an eye toward programming, building relationships, and strengthening local networks. Part of the idea behind Event Keys is that they are accessible: they are not necessarily full-fledged exhibitions or parties that require exorbitant funding or a high demand run-of-show. Event keys are often more low-lift gatherings whose resources are the onus of the group to source. Think: direct-payable direct dinners, art crawls, picnics, film screenings, or food tours.

### FWB Dinner Parties

In addition to Event Keys, this Spring you're cordially invited to host a shared meal for and with other FWB members. Use this as a chance to connect with more FWB members in your region, share a delicious meal, and cook up some new friendships.

#### How it works:

- Use [this form](https://airtable.com/shr05mgzfQqovtove) to share your interest in hosting a dinner party in your space.

- If approved, you will receive $250 USDC to spend on dinner-related expenses.

- Aim for 10+ guests, with at least 50% being FWB members.

- All official dinner parties will be added to our [Events page](https://www.fwb.help/events) via Gatekeeper so other FWB members can find them + RSVP.

- FWB's Events team will provide lightweight support to hosts to ensure your dinner party is set up for success.

- Note that all hosts will be asked to share a recipe + photos from your dinner, which we'll be compiling into a cookbook and digital zine for FWB members.

For references and further information, be sure to review [FWB’s Event Pattern Language doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5dX8D6IAmsr247f1zaBgkIKt2n9-vse/view) (aka our all-purpose manual for vibe-building), and our [Dinner-Booking SOP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s400rhaub_wl5scx64Krv4jPWnVoAqv5) (which includes a treasure trove of tips for hosting an incredible and seamlessly executed dinner).

#### FAQs:

<b> What’s expected of dinner party hosts? </b>

Hosts are expected to arrange and/or cook a meal for dinner attendees, and welcome all FWB members who RSVP into their space (note that it’s possible to limit the number of people who can RSVP). This could mean you make your dinner party a potluck and ask guests to bring a dish to share, or it could mean you make a huge batch of your grandma’s famous spaghetti and provide wine and mocktails. If you can offer versions of your dish that suit various dietary restrictions, that’s great (but not required). Hosts are also expected to help promote their dinner party and do some outreach to ensure their dinner will be well attended. Lastly, hosts are expected to follow the FWB code of conduct and ensure their party is as accessible and friendly as possible.

<b> Do I need to live in one of FWB’s main cities to host a dinner party? </b>

If you live in NYC, LA, SF, or London, that’s great—there are lots of FWB members near you, and it shouldn’t be too tricky to build a robust guest list. If you live in a region where fewer FWB members live, you’ll need to do some research/outreach to make sure enough FWB members live nearby who can come to your event. Aim to have 10 or more people at your dinner, with at least 50% of attendees being FWB members. To find members in your area, try asking in your nearest region on Discord (under the FWB REGION channel category) to see who might be your neighbor.

<b> How will FWB support dinner party hosts? </b>

FWB will supply each host with 250 USDC to spend on your dinner in whatever way makes sense. We’ll also help spread the word about the dinner party series through social media and our Events page, and we’ll provide some general tips and best practices to help ensure your dinner party is a success.

### DJ Event

#### Overview
As far as nightlife is concerned, nothing quite tells the story of a city like a night backed to the sounds of a DJ who knows what they are doing. As FWB aims to connect the world of web3 to culture, careful considerations should be made about the space and sounds we operate within, and how we go about our business. 

#### Programming

##### Dynamic Programming

Our members are a diverse group. Tastes and ideas about music will vary wildly, and it’s important that we recognise this through our event programming, but not to be governed by it. Trust your own ability to seek and find what is cool and present it in a way that feels accessible even for those with less experimental musical tastes. 

Whilst it is important to represent as much as we can, it’s important to always ask yourself the question about how the music makes sense within the boundaries of the city you operate in. Understanding the musical history of the city with a grasp on where it’s headed next should always be at the forefront of your thinking. If we are to program correctly, we need to be a step ahead of the competition, whilst respecting the tastes of the audience. Finding a balance that works will result in highly respected events which will transcend the borders of our private discord channels and elevate the FWB brand to the music and culture sector further. 

Ensure we are not repetitive in what we program to keep the city exciting and feeling alive. We can have continuity in our branding and our message, but make efforts to keep switching up the talent we book and ensure it is representative of our vision and stays true to our core values. Always be one step ahead of the game, don’t fall into the traps of booking the same tired line ups as our competitors will be doing. Thinking outside the box will be the key here - take your cues and paths from the club scene and not who is getting booked at crypto events. 

##### Programming Guiding Principles 

- Collaborate with Governance and Operations on the Macrovision of what city needs • The programming should create open and safe spaces for people to be themselves and allow for authentic connections. 
- Our programming should tell the story of where we are located, highlight our cultural partners, values and what we want to share with our guests. 
- Partners and Talent are our lifeblood, please treat accordingly. 
- All types of people reflected in programming. 
- Mix up locations we operate in. Our cities have plenty of hidden gems outside of the regular tried and tested haunts. 
- Create opportunities to bring artists into the DAO via bookings, but don’t force it - some hand-holding is to be expected at times. 
- Money is good, access is better. 

##### Booking The Venue 
Booking a venue for a date is usually the first step of planning a club night / DJ event. Depending on the kind of event you have planned, it’s important to gauge your booking on the scale of your needs and expectations for the event. If you’re booking an international headliner for an event we plan to sell tickets to the public for, you might need a larger venue. If we plan on a small open decks event for a handful of our members to DJ at, you might just want a 100 cap room with half decent sound and enough budget left to put a few drinks behind the bar. Figure out what we need, and then set about finding the space. 

If you’re an experienced clubber in your city you may already have ideas about these spaces. If you don’t, open up conversation with some of the more experienced members of your city DAO about their favorite venues around the scale you have in mind. 

Reach out to the venues. Calling by telephone is usually the best way to do this - call around an hour or two before their usual opening time and you might catch somebody who can help. Email also works - but people can be notoriously slow to get back to you due to the late nights and busy days they work. Telephone conversation followed up with an email tends to be the best practice. 

Be sure to ask questions about the following: 

- What do they supply for the cost? 
- Do they provide security? 
- Do they supply bar & staff (if this is a club / bar venue this may be standard of course)? 
- Opening hours & cut off times. 
- Do they have a person who works on the door to check tickets etc.? 
- Do they supply a sound system & sound engineer on site? 
- Is there a minimum bar spend / deposit on the price? 
- Do they take any rake of ticket sales? (Normally the promoter - FWB - should get to keep ticket revenue unless the hire fee is waived for a percentage of sales). 

Don’t hesitate to check the venue out yourself. If you’ve never been inside the venue in question, it’s important you go and have a look inside it to see if it fits your needs ahead of agreeing the dates and costs. 

If you are not booking a club / bar venue for a DJ event - you’ll also need to consider sound hire. This can be expensive and will require a lot of extra work on the day to set up - make sure you factor into your budget any hire fees for equipment and rigging should you not be booking an existing club space for a DJ event.

##### Approaching & Booking Talent 

Booking artists to play the events can vary in experience. In some cases, we’ll have people already active in the DAO who can represent what we’re about and will likely be interested in playing our events. Identify members of your city who are artists / performers and open some private dialogue about potential collaborations with them. Listen to their music / view their art and if it fits the vibe of an event you’re planning, reach out to them and see if we can make things work within budget. If we’re approaching artists from outside the DAO, conversations may be direct with them, or in many cases will be discussions with artist’s booking agents. Below are some guidelines on dealing with different types of artist. These guidelines can be applied to working with visual artists as well as DJ’s or live performers should you be incorporating that into an event. 

- Talent operating inside the DAO & is a member. 
	- Initial outreach via private Discord message. 
	- Let them know you’re planning an event and have a date in mind. 
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent. 
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the artist can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the artist on call will help get the message across to the agent. 
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with an artist present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the artist if they’ve said we can deal directly with them. 

- Talent is not a member. 
	- Find the talent on social media - twitter / instagram. See if they have an email contact for them or their agent. If they don’t have it public, send a DM where possible and ask who you can speak to about a possible booking. 
	- Give an outline about the event dates and location. 
	- Ask them if they’d be interested, and explain how our contributor payments work - if they’re interested, ask them if we’ll be dealing with them directly or if they’d like us to go via an agent. 
	- If they wish to go via an agent, suggest you all jump on a call together first so the artist can perhaps walk their agent through who we are and what we do with them - many agents will not understand what a DAO is, so we have to expect that we’ll need to explain this first. Having the artist on call will help get the message across to the agent. 
	- Make an arrangement to speak further about money with the agent on a separate call or email thread - talking budgets and figures with an artist present who has asked you to go via an agent is bad practice. Only speak budgets directly with the artist if they’ve said we can deal directly with them. 

##### Some Questions You’ll Need The Answers For.

Artists and/or booking agents will have questions about the event you have planned. It’s important you know details on the following before you engage with talent for the event. Budgets can sometimes determine how far we can stretch - but don’t feel bound by the budgets. Some artists will not expect riders and travel to be covered, but others will expect it. Make sure conversations are had on these things though so it is clear on the day of the event. 

- Date & Time of the event 
- Location of the event 
- Tech set up 
	- DJ - What is the turntable set up there? What is the setting? What kind of sound system? ○ Visual Artist - Where will they be displaying? Will we provide screens / projectors?
	- Budget - what fee do we have available to pay them? 
- Line up - talent will want to know who else they will be appearing on a lineup with. Share anyone else who is booked, or be prepared to have conversations about the other artists we’re approaching. 
- Expenses & Riders - will we be providing expenses for travel / hotels? Will we be providing food & drinks / hospitality for the talent? 

#### Marketing + Timelines 
- Create and approve all promotional assets for the event 1 week ahead of the announcement date.
- For small events exclusively for FWB members, at least 14 days notice is recommended ahead of the event to announce and promote within Discord / Town Hall / FWB Communications.
- For large club nights promoted beyond the membership group and offering up tickets to the public, a 2 month lead time is suggested. This gives a few weeks prior to public listing where FWB members and token holders can claim a ticket ahead of the event going public where the remaining capacity can be sold on regular ticketing sites like Resident Advisor. 6-8 weeks is the ideal amount of time to promote a club event online.

##### 6 Weeks Out 

- Book Venue 
	- Given the increased demand, securing a venue as early as possible will prevent headaches down the line. For certain conferences you will need more lead time. Confirm that the space you booked is appropriate for your target capacity.
- Book Talent 
	- DAO first approach, before talking to agents. Our greatest selling tool should be $FWB and payment through our token can provide access to our DAO. Try and structure your bookings to boost and broaden the DAos membership 
- Estimate Costs 
	- Once you’ve secured the talent, the venue and any food/drink packages, provide an estimation of the expenses and number of expected attendees in Airtable. 

##### 4 Weeks Out 
- Create Marketing Materials 
	- Now that you’ve locked in the programming and the venue, you can put together a flyer using our approved marketing materials and brand kit. 
- Venue Walkthrough 
	- Make sure to discuss staffing, any tech needs, menu, drinks, any type of bar arrangement (open/drinks tokens/paid) and make sure to have it all in writing so there is no misalignment in terms of expectations 
- Confirm any budget details or minimums with the venue to ensure expectations are aligned 
- Book supporting talent - think what will amplify the event further; NFT artists doing visual projections? More traditional touches like dancers or interactive content capture? 

##### 3 Weeks Out 
- Book additional production requirements - DJ kit, AV equipment and content capture. Look to the DAo first for trusted suppliers 
- Finalize flyer and Gatekeeper RSVP page 
- Get event on FWB Event Google Calendar 
- Send Event to Editorial team for coverage in TLDR (if requested) 
- Distribute RSVP link in proper Discord channels, including any temporary channels created for the specific conference 
- Send any deposit that is necessary to hold the venue

##### 1 Week Out 
- Create POAP (if distributing) & print QR codes for POAPs if needed 
- Check with the venue to make sure you are on the same page about the hours of the event and any schedule of food, or other arrangements 
- Manage the RSVP List (cut off RSVPs at a certain point if there is a venue limit, consider cutting off early if necessary to leave space for POC, women and/or FWB leadership who did not RSVP in time) 
- Confirm photographer or divvy up content creation responsibilities with local team ● Discuss settlement/payment with venue to ensure that payment expectations are set 

##### Day of Run of Show 
- Finalize guest list and make sure venue has your guest list, along with any details on whether attendees are allowed a +1 or other details, at least 3 hour prior to doors opening
- Welcome the point person from the venue and introduce yourself and any other team members to the venue staff 
- At least 1 hour before doors do a full venue walk through including the entrance and check-in points 
- Do a tech check for any AV or music equipment 
- Make sure music is on to create a vibe at least 10 minutes before doors open ● If there are any bar details that need to be discussed with the venue (open bar, bar minimum, drink sponsors or specials) double check the details day of with the staff of the venue 
- As attendees arrive, greet them and deliver POAP QR code if printed 
- Even at an open bar, do not get intoxicated 
- “Settle up” (thoroughly review the bill, and other charges, and making remaining payments) the night of the event (or the next day if prearranged with the venue) so that there are no lingering issues with payment 

##### Post 
- Reconcile budget and upload all receipts to airtable 
- Collect any content 
- Conduct guestlist review/attendance rates for future intel 
- Provide TL;DR to cityDAO’s at large with learnings and successes 

#### Questions To Ask 
- What story are we telling with our programming? 
- What will people tell their friends about FWB? 
- How is programming driving brand awareness? 
- How can we use programming to make an impression? 
- How is programming driving applications? 
- How do we support the community?
- What larger events can we make?

### Grand Dining

#### Overview
On rare occasions, we go all out. Holidays, Season Openers / Closers, Prom. These productions require loads of work and intersect many skill sets. On the grandest of shows, we have created a framework to incorporate the Global team, the City, and the vendors that it takes to make it happen.
This type of programming should only be done once a season. These events are legendary but also need a lot of attention. Be mindful of the resources necessary to pull this off.

#### Goals
A large format event should have some very specific goals when going all out on the programming. When you’re creating a Grand Event, consider the following as some important indicators of success:
- Driving value to the token
- Creating valuable experiences for the community
- Building brand awareness and positive sentiment in other communities
- Building bridges between FWB and the local community
- Creating on-ramps for non-members to join

#### Programming
Programming a Grand Event will require specialization in the creative, operational, logistical, and production capacity across food and drink, audio / visual presentation, arts and culture, transportation, security, and the battery of elements that come together to make a large-scale fete.

**IS IT VIABLE?**
- Are there enough members for success?
- Is it organic to the local membership?
- Do we have the resources to produce this experience meaningfully?
- Does this serve members of all ages, abilities, and reasonable preferences?
- Will this matter?

**STAY ON STRATEGY**
- Collaborate with [Governance and Operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJ-8sgLcnAXKIlvzm7CtnW5x-GUqfSJxv1_AENaxyy0/edit) on the macro-objectives of the City
- Remain aligned and additive to the strategy of the local membership
- Leverage this moment as a key event in the overall seasonal / annual strategy
- Create achievable KPIs around the event for you to measure success and improvement

**PLATFORM OTHERS**
- Use the moment and resources to connect other communities to ours
Program the network diversity we wish to see reflected within our own community
- Leverage our access

**SAFETY FIRST W/ FOOD & DRINK**
- Always consider accessibility, geography, transportation, and security
- Never serve alcohol to a minor
- Always play the host by observing and taking responsibility for the occasion
- Never promote the overconsumption of alcohol
- Always ask the audience to provide any life threatening allergies to you directly and communicate with the Chef / restaurant to ensure there is no mistake

#### Event Safety
“Hospitality is present when something happens for you. It is absent when something happens to you. Those two simple prepositions - for and to - express it all.” - Danny Meyer

An event is a multi-sensory hospitality experience. The act of sharing content

#### SETUP
##### Determine Type of Experience
FWB Cities recommends three styles of dining events for our community:
- **Culinary Experiences (Small)**
	This is the epicurean celebration of food and it’s process, centering the conversation on the dining experience itself with a fully seated and detailed service of food, drink, and accoutrement
- **Group Dining (Medium)**
	The most typical dining event for communion exists in restaurants, residences, or pop up experiences with less choreography and cerebral food and drink service in favor of feeding friends together. Group dining is often served family style, plattered, potluck, or as a buffet. Rarely does Group Dining make sense with individual guest orders.
- **Local Flavor (Large)**
	These are non-exclusive dining destinations that can accommodate the masses. Local flavor is all about quick service and volume. Think beer halls, wine gardens, food courts, pizzerias, taquerias, sandwich shops, coffee shops, curry shops, and more... These are by nature, community establishments and have the infrastructure to host large groups on demand.
	
In general, dining events can be elaborate and expensive, or informal and communal. To organize pricing and selections, the table below is relevant to the US but is also decent for most developed nations currency exchange:
- Luxury: >$200pp + tax + gratuity (25%) + additional customization
- Premium: $100pp + tax + gratuity (20%)
- Banquet: $50pp + tax + gratuity (15%)
- Casual: $25pp + tax + gratuity (10%)
- Economical: <$25pp + tax

##### Event Examples :
- **(SMALL / PREMIUM CULINARY EXPERIENCE)** FWB NYC is hosting a recruitment dinner for our most active members that have onboarded new memberships, it will be a premium culinary experience for 12 guests at Porcelain in Ridgewood, around $2400 from the monthly budget to net 12 new members from this group.
- **(MEDIUM / CASUAL GROUP DINING)** FWB LA is doing a casual dinner party for 30 people at Highly Likely Cafe with member Chef Kat Turner who is gifting her space and charging $3000 all in for the private dinner, followed by cocktails for 30 more members.
- **(LARGE / ECONOMICAL LOCAL FLAVOR)** FWB MIAMI is hosting a day party to celebrate the chapter launch and approval of 250 new memberships in Season 5. Sweet Beach can accommodate a walkup BBQ sandwich station for 300 guests at $25 per person.

#####Choosing Event Day
**Choosing an event day is tricky.** Strong organizers know when to crowdsource answers and source answers for the crowd. Over time, this will become more predictive and intuitive. In the earlier stages, we recommend crowdsourcing broad schedules. Once you’ve selected the venue, you should crowdsource the event date:
- Check calendars for holidays that may indicate members traveling out of town
- Choose two date options and offer a vote with Reactions (Discord)
- Don’t overcomplicate, just suggest a couple of date options and go with the higher tally

##### Event Hours
Each dining event is going to be unique but **three hours is a good rule of thumb.** Some things to
remember:
- Set up and breakdown can take a few hours on each side of the event
- Communication with your guests will take a few hours on each side of the event
- 90 minutes is a good time limit for seating, after that it can get boring for the guest
- Allow 30 minutes for guest arrivals
- Allow an hour for guests to mingle to follow

When booking a meal period, use your instinct on the local geography and understand the general availability of the membership. Consider the following:
- What’s the traffic in your local area?
- Is there parking near the venue?
- Will people be able to arrive within 30 minutes of the start time?

Pro-tips for keeping people on time:
- Share a Google calendar invite with the reminders turned on
- Push messaging in local channels around strict seating times
- Limit capacity of every event and make sure there is always demand for the next

##### Venue & Size
Leads should possess a working knowledge of relevant venues in the city to host experiences. This includes food and drink establishments in varying neighborhoods of the City they lead. Use your best judgement to pick the vibe, here’s some standards:
- Best to have indoor and outdoor areas
- Mom and pop / independently owned business (ie. non-chain restaurant or establishment)
- Encouraged to look for establishments that are womxn / LGBTQ+ / POC owned
- Quality ambience free of fluorescent lights, offensive music, or questionable authenticity
- Climate control for heating / cooling / coverage in inclement weather
- An area that feels private or semi-private to the group
- An ambient volume or volume control that allows people to hear one another speak
- If outdoors, a floor to move on wheels or heels
- Parking accessible within a safe distance

##### Booking an Establishment
- Choose a location in the city that fits the above
- Visit the venue for a bite and a chance to get a vibe
- Assess the F&B offering to accommodate common dining restrictions (GF, DF, V, VEG)
- If it’s a fit and feeling, ask for a manager on duty and tell them you’d like to host an event
- Ask the number of guests they can accommodate for group dining
- Visit any private or semi-private for dining
- Find out if you can play your own music
- If it seems easy, it will be
- If it seems complicated, it will be
- Get the contact information and shake hands
- Follow up with a correspondence with the following in mind:
	- For a Dining Experience: you’ll likely return to the venue or need a call / meeting to plan
	- For Group Dining: ask for prix fixe or family style menus they offer
	-  For Local Flavor events: confirm the hours of operation on your intended event day
- Make sure there is room to reduce or increase capacity 20% of seats available
- Ask for their availability for two dates in the weeks to follow
- Return to the #channel and propose the two dates for Reaction vote
- Take the prevailing vote and confirm the date with the venue
- Make a deposit if required

##### Producing a Dining Event (Off Site Dining)
When hosting a dinner at a residential, private, or non-commercial space, there are an endless array of variables to consider. This is a practical guide to making the most of your dining event:
- What makes the venue more special than the convenience of an establishment?
- If that’s hard to answer, go to an establishment. If that’s easy, continue on...
- Does the venue meet the same criteria as the restaurant selection?
- Is the point of contact the final decision maker, owner, or operator?
- If yes, great. If not, find out who it is and be clear about the expectation. Make sure they approve.
- Visit the venue prior to event, take tons of photos of all areas and document the condition
- Communicate with the host or manager to confirm:
	- The venue is large enough to accommodate the guests
	- You can access the venue 3+ hours in advance of the event to prepare
	- The venue is clean for the guests arrival
	- The space is in working order (lights, restrooms, sound, parking)
	- If you are cooking in the venue, take notes on the following;
		- Gas, electric and plumbing are in working order
		- The heavy cooking equipment you can use
		- The pots, pans, and cooking utensils you can use
		- The cleaning supplies you can use
		- Whatever you can not use, you will bring
	- For service:
		- Count the number of plates, platters, silverware, and glassware inventory
		- If enough for the event, confirm you can use all of it
		- If not, order tossware / compostables or pickup at a party supply store
		- Make sure the refrigeration and freezer can be emptied in advance
		- If not, bring a cooler and ice bucket
- Type up your notes and confirm on email
- Once the date is confirmed with the host, buy event insurance from EventHelper.com
- Share the certificate issued with the host for peace of mind for all
- Order some handy items in advance:
	- Wine key and opener
	- Blue painters tape / labels and a Sharpie
	- 6 pack of toilet paper
	- 6 rolls paper towels
	- Cutting board and knife
	- Lighter
	- Votive candles
	- A couple extra large bowls or platters if you have them
	- Serving spoons
	- Napkins
	- Food storage containers for leftover food
	- Anything else that’s not provided

#### Ticketing & RSVP
You need to create the promotional materials and registration for your event. All FWB events will utilize the Gatekeeper platform for RSVPs. This can host all your event details and utilize a tokengated, Web3 RSVP system:
- Create the event invitation using these Canva Templates:
	- [Square Flyer Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8ev5Thw/dV3cGxRNrt_AXoulh1qOGQ/view?utm_content=DAFX8ev5Thw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)
	- [IG Stories Template](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFX8eJ_PAk/6kJeQyDo8gVIlppM83pitw/view?utm_content=DAFX8eJ_PAk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink&mode=preview)

- Load your event and details to the [Gatekeeper app](https://gatekeep.it/)
- Have your Operations counterpart proof the work
- Test drive the platform and run through the process

#### Marketing & Promotion
By crowdsourcing a time and date, you’ve engaged the crowd to co-author the experience. Now it’s time to publish and build anticipation. Steps ahead:

- Create an invite and RSVP on Gatekeeper app
- Make sure to leave 10% of seating available to the very last minute
	- Ex. if there are 20 seats at a table, only publish 18 for RSVP, the last two are reserved
- Token gate the RSVP for 75+ $FWB for one day to reserve a seat
- Reduce the gate to 5+ $FWB for the remaining seats
- When the RSVPs are full, announce to the #Channel
- Send reminders in the timelines below 50/50 the share of voice with promoting the event with your counterpart
- Publish a Dining Event with minimum 7 days notice
	- Share with FWB editorial / social team to incorporate in weekly comms
	- Craft an @everyone message on the City channel
	- Keep it tidy using formats to bold the date, time, address
- Drop the link daily with a reminder to RSVP for those that may have missed the post
- On event day, make sure DMs are open for members of the server
- Send a final reminder in the morning
- Once on site, send a photo to the #channel with a detail or ambiance of the venue Use the channel for any attendance updates


#### TIMELINE (14 DAYS) - Minimum suggested for execution

- Keep an email or a note open on your phone, jotting down a name and a detail from the evening
- Shoot photos throughout the evening or designate / hire a photographer
- Introduce people during the event with any context except “work”
- Thank everyone for attending in the morning
- If you took notes on the evening, add people as friends and follows with DMs about the details
- Give everyone an abstract date in the future to look forward to for the next one

##### Things to Bring:
- Florals and decor
- Print bootleg FWB merch / stickers / pins / fun stuff
- Disposable or Polaroid camera (takes the pressure off phone photos)
- If seated, magic marker name tags “HELLO MY NAME IS” work great
- Pins, stickers, or other identifying wearables to distinguish the audience for the venue
- Brick batteries with cables to help people charge phones

#### The Short Version 

**Digital Event Expectations:**

If you are hosting a Digital Event, expectations are as follows:

- Well thought out event that sounds professional and starts promptly. If the event is recurring, it should be reliable.
- Share description/guests/topics minimum 48hrs before air time, and ideally by Wednesday at midnight the week prior so we can get it in tl;dr.
- Strive for a minimum attendance of 2% of the active FWB community, and track event attendance. (This amounts to around 20 people in the audience)
- Record and share recordings after the event if you want the event to be archived.
- Engage with the editorial team and community for event promotion.

People showing up for live events is the best metric for success. You will report your real-time attendance, and we will have the data on how many people listen to the archived version of the show. We also of course encourage soliciting feedback on your event so you can improve for the next time :)

**What To Do Before And After Each Event:**

Before: You must submit [this form](https://forms.gle/bhciK4dGrtufEMeN7) at least 48 hours before your event, preferably by Thursday the week before your show so we can promote in tl;dr. This form includes date, time, location (which voice channel will you be on? Is it on main stage? Is it on zoom? Twitter spaces?), show description and a spot to upload art if you have any.

After: Submit [this form](https://forms.gle/7LHAUtaouKC1jxqW6) after each event. This is where you report attendance and give us a link to your event recording if you want it to be archived. This form must be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

**How to record**

If you know how to record from discord using Krisp, OBS, Garageband or Soundflower, please feel free to do so. Here is a guide to using [Krisp](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) and here is a guide for [OBS.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uJssyu6DNQsjQtdgKS-OwqKunkaMiEraagGMk3fmNJ4/edit) You can always reach out to Zoe in the [#digitalevents](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/984259876433829948) channel for help with recording but there is no guarantee that she will be free to record.

If you host your event on Zoom or Twitter Spaces, recording is easy peasy!

#### A Step-By-Step Guide

**STEP 1: Lock in the details and get on the calendar**

First, we need to get you on the schedule. We need a title, description of your event, location and a date/time at least 48 hours in advance. You can try to find a good time by taking a look at the [FWB Events Calendar](https://www.fwb.help/events) and finding an empty block of time. It is best to leave some buffer between each event to allow more folks to attend and avoid channel overlap. For locations, either tell us which discord voice channel you will be in, or include a zoom link or a twitter spaces link etc. Once you have all of the info, please fill out the [FWB Digital Events - Calendar Info Form](https://forms.gle/MaQ7RoEHvKN1Tj238) so that we can add the event to the events page, discord calendar and to the google calendar. You can also upload art or a flier here which adds some color to your post when it gets announced on the discord. (If you send along art, make sure it is less than 10 MB).

**STEP 2: Plan your event**

Events are best received when they are well thought out. Who are your guests? Do you want people to be able to participate in the conversation?

Do you want this event to be archived? If so, how are you going to record your event? Do you have guests who are not on the discord? If so, we will need to grant them access so we will need to know ahead of time.

**STEP 3: Show Time**

Make sure you have everything ready to go. Here are some things to think about:

- Getting outside guests into the discord. You will need to send their discord handles to Derek or Raihan ahead of time. Give them at least 24 hours of warning and be sure to follow up with them an hour before your event so we aren’t scrambling at the last minute.
- Recording your event. If you want your event to be archived, you are responsible for getting it recorded. If you know how to record from discord already, awesome! If not, you can use [Krisp Audio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZm6uZoaCWPpy2bXhCTeV96OUWIrn18J9J_3z1mG6LA/edit?usp=sharing) or OBS to do so. We highly recommend trying this out early!! It isn't trivial and you don't want to be troubleshooting this real time. HINT: Recording on zoom is SUPER easy, and you get video! So this is not a bad option. Twitter Spaces also records for you so that is another easy solution. When you are done recording your event, save it as either an mp3 (audio) or mp4 (video). The file must be named like this: YYYYMMDD_Event Name.mp3 You will include a link to this file when you submit to the archive (Step 4).
- Reporting real time attendance. You must give us a rough count of how many people attended your event in real time. It doesn’t need to be exact, but try to give us a ballpark number.
- Sound Quality. This one is HUGE!! While discord chaos is charming, it can also get annoying. We recommend that you and your guests do your calls with headphones on to optimize your mic sounds and limit risk of echos and discord sounds. It is also great if you can turn off your discord notification sounds and silence any other notifications on your computer and your phone. Also, pay attention to your audience and mute them or ask them to mute if they are making a lot of noise. If you need someone to help server mute, you can reach out to anyone in the AV Club to help, but usually a polite call out will do the trick.

**STEP 4: Submit to the archive and provide a post-event report.**

When you are done with your event, fill out this form: FWB Digital Events - Post-Event Report and Archive Submission. This form has to be submitted within 24 hours of the event.

This is where you can tell us your attendance and give us your recording to upload to the archive. You can give us a more detailed description of the event to be attached to the entry in the archive, think podcast show notes. You can also upload art here if you hadn’t added it in time to make it on the calendar.
